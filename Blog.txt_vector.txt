 One
 of
 the
 things
 Ive
 always
 wondered
 about
 Superheroes
 is
 whether
 they
 had
 to
 workout
 for
 their
 muscles
 or
 if
 they
 just
 kind
 of
 naturally
 came
 with
 the
 gig
 I
 always
 assumed
 the
 latter
 but
 then
 FatThor
 in
 AvengersEndgame
 threw
 me
 for
 a
 loop
 Like
 were
 he
 and
 Clark
 Kent
 counting
 their
 macros
 and
 bench
 pressing
 trains
 while
 no
 one
 was
 watching
 If
 you
 think
 about
 it
 Toby
 Maguires
 SpiderMan
 became
 instantaneously
 jacked
 when
 he
 was
 bit
 
 but
 Spiderverse
 Peter
 ended
 up
 with
 a
 belly
 Billy
 Batson
 is
 naturally
 ripped
 in
 his
 Shazam
 form
 but
 Mr
 Incredible
 had
 to
 workout
 and
 eat
 properly
 in
 order
 to
 take
 several
 inches
 off
 of
 his
 waist
 Is
 MuscleThor
 significantly
 stronger
 than
 FatThor
 It
 doesnt
 seem
 like
 it
 If
 theyre
 the
 same
 strength
 then
 was
 Thors
 body
 purely
 for
 aesthetics
 Also
 if
 MuscleThor
 is
 stronger
 
 how
 much
 of
 a
 difference
 does
 lifting
 actually
 make
 considering
 he
 is
 already
 a
 God
 Along
 the
 same
 vein
 has
 the
 Flash
 capped
 out
 in
 speed
 or
 could
 he
 become
 even
 faster
 through
 training
 Could
 we
 ever
 see
 a
 FatHulk
 or
 a
 severely
 skinny
 Thanos
 If
 Asgardian
 Gods
 can
 become
 fat
 what
 other
 biochemistry
 do
 they
 share
 with
 humans
 Could
 they
 develop
 cancerous
 cells
 contract
 a
 sexually
 transmitted
 disease
 or
 have
 a
 gluten
 intolerance
 The
 way
 I
 see
 it
 we
 are
 left
 with
 two
 options
 Either
 
 Superheroes
 are
 predestined
 to
 have
 a
 certain
 strength
 and
 body
 composition
 or
 
 Superheroes
 have
 to
 workout
 eat
 properly
 and
 get
 adequate
 amounts
 of
 sleep
 in
 order
 to
 maintain
 their
 physique
 Both
 of
 these
 options
 just
 feel
 intuitively
 wrong
 The
 idea
 that
 people
 lose
 weight
 because
 they
 eat
 less
 calories
 than
 they
 expend
 is
 technically
 right
 but
 functionally
 wrong
 
 a
 sort
 of
 Luciferian
 halftruth
 halflie
 Yes
 
 in
 order
 to
 accumulate
 subcutaneous
 fat
 there
 has
 to
 be
 a
 caloric
 surplus
 However
 as
 far
 as
 I
 can
 tell
 that
 statement
 doesnt
 actually
 communicate
 any
 meaningful
 information
 It
 only
 begs
 the
 question
 WHY
 did
 the
 calorie
 surplus
 occur
 in
 the
 first
 place
 The
 prevailing
 narrative
 is
 that
 people
 are
 hedonistic
 and
 lazy
 They
 dont
 know
 when
 to
 put
 the
 fork
 down
 and
 wont
 get
 off
 their
 fat
 asses
 to
 exercise
 This
 is
 not
 only
 wrong
 but
 dangerous
 People
 have
 been
 given
 dietary
 advice
 that
 makes
 fat
 loss
 impossible
 and
 then
 shamed
 into
 thinking
 that
 they
 lack
 the
 willpower
 to
 succeed
 The
 calories
 in
 calories
 out
 hypothesis
 treats
 all
 calorically
 equal
 foods
 as
 qualitatively
 equal
 
 calories
 is
 
 calories
 whether
 it
 comes
 from
 chicken
 beef
 cake
 pasta
 celery
 or
 canola
 oil
 What
 you
 eat
 affects
 how
 much
 you
 eat
 Women
 get
 cravings
 on
 their
 periods
 men
 slim
 out
 and
 build
 muscle
 when
 taking
 testosterone
 people
 lose
 their
 appetite
 when
 depressed
 and
 weve
 all
 eaten
 when
 were
 stressed
 Hormones
 and
 other
 physiological
 indicators
 hunger
 satiety
 insulin
 blood
 sugar
 sleep
 energy
 cravings
 etc
 are
 crucial
 variables
 when
 considering
 eating
 behavior
 and
 its
 subsequent
 effect
 on
 weight
 regulation
 Of
 course
 the
 nutrition
 profile
 qualitative
 of
 the
 food
 we
 eat
 is
 directly
 correlated
 with
 these
 barometers
 What
 you
 eat
 affects
 how
 much
 you
 eat
 You
 would
 never
 call
 someone
 a
 hedonist
 if
 they
 felt
 the
 need
 to
 drink
 more
 water
 than
 their
 body
 actually
 needed
 If
 somebody
 was
 chronically
 tired
 despite
 consistently
 getting
 sufficient
 sleep
 wouldnt
 you
 look
 to
 other
 confounding
 factors
 that
 might
 be
 affecting
 their
 energy
 instead
 of
 telling
 them
 to
 sleep
 less
 Instead
 of
 asking
 why
 cant
 people
 stop
 eating
 I
 think
 the
 better
 question
 is
 why
 is
 everyone
 always
 hungry
 Footnote
 I
 have
 no
 idea
 what
 the
 best
 diet
 is
 
 and
 this
 post
 isnt
 trying
 to
 posit
 an
 answer
 All
 Im
 suggesting
 is
 the
 current
 system
 of
 thought
 surrounding
 the
 obesity
 epidemic
 is
 maladaptive
 In
 an
 attempt
 to
 repeat
 myself
 loudly
 and
 often
 let
 me
 say
 it
 again
 secondary
 colors
 are
 for
 villains
 and
 betas
 only
 All
 the
 main
 heroes
 wear
 primary
 colors
 Superman
 Wonder
 Woman
 Spiderman
 Ironman
 Captain
 America
 Mario
 Inversely
 all
 major
 villains
 and
 blist
 heroes
 wear
 secondary
 colors
 Luigi
 Joker
 Green
 Goblin
 Hulk
 Thanos
 Loki
 Aquaman
 Lex
 Luthor
 This
 artistic
 choice
 obviously
 is
 intentional
 the
 writers
 are
 trying
 to
 communicate
 something
 important
 about
 the
 characters
 through
 their
 clothing
 Eww
 orange
 Who
 the
 hell
 wears
 orange
 Velma
 Mermaid
 Man
 Vector
 committing
 crimes
 with
 both
 direction
 and
 magnitude
 Dora
 And
 dont
 even
 get
 me
 started
 on
 green
 Looking
 at
 you
 Mike
 Wazowski
 Shrek
 Grinch
 Plankton
 Billie
 with
 her
 green
 hair
 gets
 a
 pass
 shes
 Americas
 darling
 right
 now
 The
 rest
 of
 you
 need
 to
 get
 your
 shit
 together
 
 theres
 a
 reason
 Halloween
 colors
 are
 purple
 green
 and
 orange
 No
 Country
 for
 Old
 Men
 is
 a
 masterpiece
 
 engaging
 you
 from
 the
 start
 and
 subverting
 your
 expectations
 in
 all
 the
 right
 ways
 It
 draws
 on
 the
 oldest
 archetypal
 theme
 of
 the
 human
 experience
 order
 and
 chaos
 but
 introduces
 a
 level
 of
 moral
 ambiguity
 that
 leaves
 you
 walking
 away
 thinking
 What
 the
 hell
 just
 happened
 On
 the
 surface
 the
 movie
 starts
 out
 trying
 to
 convince
 you
 its
 a
 classic
 western
 Good
 guy
 chasing
 treasure
 
 bad
 guy
 trying
 to
 stop
 him
 Weve
 seen
 it
 a
 hundred
 times
 Cormac
 MCCarthy
 is
 too
 smart
 for
 that
 though
 The
 hero
 is
 killed
 off
 screen
 the
 bad
 guy
 gets
 away
 the
 money
 is
 lost
 and
 the
 deuteragonist
 ends
 up
 depressed
 All
 of
 this
 underlined
 by
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 film
 doesnt
 have
 a
 single
 music
 score
 It
 was
 never
 about
 Llewelyn
 and
 it
 was
 never
 about
 Chigurh
 The
 movie
 is
 called
 No
 Country
 for
 Old
 Men
 and
 thats
 exactly
 what
 its
 about
 an
 old
 man
 that
 doesnt
 belong
 This
 movie
 is
 about
 Bell
 
 and
 what
 he
 represents
 Bell
 is
 a
 police
 officer
 
 an
 upholder
 of
 the
 law
 both
 allegorically
 and
 literally
 He
 wants
 morality
 and
 justice
 to
 be
 straight
 forward
 clear
 cut
 delineations
 between
 right
 and
 wrong
 As
 the
 audience
 we
 watch
 this
 idealistic
 worldview
 progressively
 shatter
 until
 he
 ultimately
 becomes
 disillusioned
 Standing
 as
 a
 foil
 Anton
 represents
 the
 seemingly
 arbitrary
 nature
 of
 reward
 and
 punishment
 
 validating
 Gods
 claim
 to
 maketh
 his
 sun
 to
 rise
 on
 the
 evil
 and
 on
 the
 good
 and
 sendeth
 rain
 on
 the
 just
 and
 on
 the
 unjust
 Matthew
 
 He
 embodies
 chaos
 
 cold
 and
 dispassionate
 drawing
 no
 meaningful
 distinction
 between
 humans
 and
 bovines
 hence
 the
 cattle
 bolt
 stunner
 he
 uses
 to
 kill
 His
 motivations
 are
 completely
 unclear
 
 and
 he
 shows
 little
 to
 no
 emotion
 throughout
 the
 film
 even
 after
 getting
 hit
 by
 a
 car
 or
 selfperforming
 surgery
 Whether
 the
 Gods
 will
 smile
 on
 you
 or
 not
 is
 as
 arbitrary
 as
 a
 coin
 flip
 I
 mean
 If
 the
 rule
 you
 followed
 brought
 you
 to
 this
 
 then
 of
 what
 use
 was
 the
 rule
 Its
 a
 moral
 relativism
 steelman
 at
 its
 finest
 Bell
 cant
 hold
 that
 space
 The
 movie
 ends
 with
 him
 recounting
 a
 dream
 
 where
 his
 father
 rode
 into
 the
 night
 carrying
 a
 torch
 to
 light
 the
 way
 He
 wants
 traditional
 old
 fatherly
 values
 to
 dictate
 the
 way
 we
 orient
 ourselves
 Thats
 not
 the
 world
 we
 live
 in
 though
 Ambiguity
 and
 uncertainty
 exist
 everywhere
 This
 isnt
 a
 country
 for
 Old
 Men
 
 you
 cant
 be
 naive
 and
 toxically
 optimistic
 However
 cynicism
 and
 nihilism
 arent
 a
 solution
 either
 McCarthy
 doesnt
 try
 to
 resolve
 the
 conflict
 Rather
 like
 all
 great
 artists
 he
 allows
 the
 audience
 to
 figure
 it
 out
 for
 themselves
 Falling
 in
 love
 isnt
 hard
 were
 biologically
 inclined
 to
 find
 someone
 and
 get
 attached
 its
 easy
 if
 you
 try
 People
 act
 like
 love
 is
 special
 but
 you
 can
 hotwire
 the
 connection
 try
 these
 simple
 hacks
 with
 anyone
 things
 will
 move
 in
 the
 right
 direction
 Make
 inside
 jokes
 then
 gossip
 swap
 saliva
 trauma
 bond
 the
 neurochemical
 reaction
 will
 make
 your
 feelings
 correspond
 Oxytocin
 when
 you
 cuddle
 you
 get
 dopamine
 from
 kissing
 serotonin
 from
 social
 status
 cortisol
 when
 they
 are
 missing
 You
 start
 to
 date
 and
 things
 are
 great
 till
 
 months
 in
 the
 feelings
 fade
 
 its
 a
 sign
 theyre
 not
 the
 one
 for
 you
 their
 love
 was
 a
 charade
 You
 ball
 your
 fists
 in
 anger
 and
 curse
 your
 God
 above
 it
 feels
 like
 an
 injustice
 to
 keep
 falling
 out
 of
 love
 Falling
 in
 love
 is
 an
 addiction
 and
 just
 like
 any
 other
 stimuli
 you
 discard
 when
 its
 convenient
 and
 chase
 a
 newer
 better
 high
 We
 need
 to
 reconceptualize
 the
 definitions
 really
 matter
 
 love
 is
 not
 the
 disney
 phase
 its
 the
 commitment
 that
 comes
 after
 If
 you
 lie
 to
 somebody
 and
 they
 believe
 it
 not
 only
 does
 it
 eat
 away
 at
 your
 own
 soul
 
 but
 you
 grow
 to
 resent
 them
 I
 dont
 fully
 understand
 why
 Maybe
 you
 begin
 to
 feel
 like
 they
 dont
 know
 you
 well
 enough
 to
 recognize
 youre
 lying
 Or
 worse
 that
 they
 dont
 care
 to
 know
 you
 well
 enough
 Maybe
 you
 feel
 theyre
 too
 stupid
 to
 catch
 on
 Or
 maybe
 you
 feel
 bad
 about
 lying
 so
 youre
 externalizing
 the
 problem
 or
 projecting
 or
 something
 like
 that
 I
 dont
 know
 But
 as
 unfair
 as
 it
 is
 
 you
 almost
 lose
 respect
 for
 someone
 who
 would
 et
 you
 get
 away
 with
 it
 So
 even
 if
 you
 dont
 get
 caught
 lying
 still
 damages
 the
 relationship
 So
 dont
 lie
 Straw
 berry
 days
 is
 a
 fitting
 title
 because
 this
 festival
 absolutely
 sucks
 The
 rides
 
 stars
 The
 food
 
 stars
 The
 strawberries
 Couldnt
 tell
 you
 
 because
 despite
 its
 name
 I
 have
 yet
 to
 see
 a
 single
 one
 of
 the
 sweet
 soft
 sensual
 fruits
 with
 the
 seedstudded
 surface
 Have
 I
 ever
 gone
 to
 Strawberry
 Days
 and
 not
 been
 disappointed
 Once
 Has
 Tre
 ever
 gone
 to
 Strawberry
 Days
 and
 not
 been
 disappointed
 Nonce
 Am
 I
 going
 to
 keep
 asking
 myself
 rhetorical
 questions
 Well
 thats
 what
 I
 end
 up
 doing
 every
 time
 Im
 there
 so
 I
 feel
 like
 its
 only
 fitting
 I
 mean
 which
 of
 us
 hasnt
 thought
 Did
 I
 actually
 spend
 money
 on
 this
 or
 Why
 can
 I
 see
 half
 the
 buttcheek
 of
 every
 
 year
 old
 girl
 here
 Ive
 had
 more
 fun
 getting
 cavities
 filled
 theres
 at
 least
 laughing
 gas
 Next
 time
 lets
 shoot
 for
 more
 strawberries
 at
 the
 strawberry
 festival
 
 star
 If
 I
 ask
 you
 how
 many
 people
 you
 hate
 and
 you
 say
 zero
 then
 I
 dont
 trust
 you
 Everybody
 should
 hate
 at
 least
 somebody
 Hate
 is
 a
 strong
 word
 Yeah
 its
 a
 strong
 word
 for
 a
 strong
 emotion
 quit
 moralizing
 it
 Feelings
 arent
 good
 or
 bad
 
 I
 mean
 some
 of
 them
 are
 unpleasant
 
 but
 theyre
 just
 emotions
 Theyre
 useful
 Besides
 if
 you
 dont
 have
 the
 capacity
 to
 hate
 then
 love
 doesnt
 really
 mean
 anything
 anyways
 Were
 not
 very
 good
 at
 following
 the
 ecclesiastical
 wisdom
 there
 is
 a
 time
 for
 everything
 and
 a
 season
 for
 every
 activity
 under
 the
 heavens
 Theres
 justice
 and
 mercy
 chaos
 and
 order
 Compassion
 is
 a
 good
 thing
 
 but
 taken
 too
 far
 and
 it
 becomes
 a
 vice
 Sometimes
 you
 should
 turn
 the
 other
 cheek
 other
 times
 you
 need
 to
 grab
 your
 whip
 and
 cleanse
 a
 temple
 Theres
 a
 time
 to
 love
 and
 a
 time
 to
 hate
 Theres
 something
 vivifying
 
 almost
 life
 giving
 about
 hatred
 I
 like
 having
 an
 antagonist
 in
 life
 
 somebody
 to
 root
 against
 Its
 lifes
 second
 greatest
 motivator
 behind
 heartbreak
 Also
 cmon
 Everybody
 knew
 at
 least
 one
 bitch
 from
 high
 school
 that
 still
 makes
 your
 blood
 boil
 Sunday
 The
 four
 letter
 word
 of
 six
 letter
 words
 As
 a
 schoolboy
 it
 marked
 the
 end
 of
 a
 hedonistic
 
 hours
 
 exchanging
 latenights
 and
 video
 games
 for
 mechanical
 pencils
 and
 tardy
 slips
 As
 an
 adult
 however
 the
 feelings
 of
 dread
 take
 on
 a
 new
 form
 
 as
 Saturday
 softly
 slips
 and
 Sunday
 sentiments
 slowly
 surface
 Sunday
 When
 the
 feral
 beast
 wakes
 from
 his
 hebdomadal
 slumber
 And
 by
 what
 name
 does
 the
 savage
 answer
 Boredom
 See
 an
 idle
 brain
 is
 the
 devils
 workshop
 and
 the
 prince
 of
 darkness
 might
 as
 well
 call
 his
 enterprise
 AlLifKcihc
 because
 especially
 for
 the
 perennially
 preoccupied
 sometimes
 it
 is
 only
 open
 on
 Sundays
 Born
 into
 relatively
 moderate
 circumstances
 at
 the
 age
 of
 
 during
 his
 trip
 to
 the
 petting
 zoo
 in
 Scipio
 our
 hero
 mistakes
 a
 group
 of
 poison
 dart
 frogs
 as
 being
 a
 part
 of
 the
 exhibit
 Picking
 them
 up
 in
 his
 arms
 hes
 fatally
 wounded
 but
 survives
 the
 experience
 and
 as
 a
 consequence
 gains
 the
 lung
 capacity
 of
 
 times
 a
 regular
 human
 Driven
 to
 the
 depths
 of
 depression
 by
 the
 mundanity
 of
 life
 among
 normal
 humans
 and
 the
 burden
 of
 his
 secret
 he
 flees
 to
 Nepal
 to
 escape
 his
 selfloathing
 where
 he
 runs
 into
 a
 female
 member
 of
 the
 League
 of
 Shadows
 at
 Bed
 Bath
 and
 Beyond
 Of
 course
 he
 is
 stricken
 by
 her
 innate
 physical
 beauty
 
 but
 more
 importantly
 he
 overhears
 he
 referring
 to
 a
 partially
 used
 candle
 as
 being
 in
 its
 Waxing
 Gibbous
 Phase
 a
 delightful
 pun
 and
 falls
 for
 her
 immediately
 He
 makes
 noticeable
 eyecontact
 with
 her
 several
 times
 but
 lacks
 the
 selfconfidence
 to
 make
 a
 corporeal
 approach
 Finally
 to
 his
 delight
 she
 approaches
 him
 They
 chitchat
 for
 a
 while
 and
 eventually
 she
 says
 You
 know
 Im
 not
 supposed
 to
 do
 this
 but
 would
 you
 like
 to
 come
 back
 to
 my
 place
 He
 agrees
 Partly
 because
 of
 her
 natural
 beauty
 and
 down
 to
 earth
 nature
 
 but
 mostly
 out
 of
 pure
 intrigue
 Why
 isnt
 she
 supposed
 to
 have
 guys
 over
 Why
 wont
 she
 tell
 him
 her
 name
 He
 makes
 a
 mental
 note
 to
 assign
 her
 the
 alias
 of
 Gibbous
 and
 they
 make
 their
 way
 back
 to
 her
 apartment
 After
 a
 few
 hours
 of
 monopoly
 he
 ends
 up
 staying
 the
 night
 There
 was
 no
 physical
 intimacy
 involved
 because
 they
 both
 had
 clearcut
 standards
 and
 would
 never
 kiss
 somebody
 on
 the
 first
 date
 Waking
 up
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 night
 to
 get
 a
 glass
 of
 water
 as
 he
 stumbles
 across
 the
 room
 in
 the
 dark
 he
 accidentally
 pulls
 down
 a
 secret
 lever
 masquerading
 as
 a
 succulent
 revealing
 a
 hidden
 room
 Upon
 entering
 he
 immediately
 notices
 a
 giant
 rug
 with
 the
 head
 of
 the
 demon
 insignia
 and
 several
 swords
 mounted
 on
 the
 wall
 He
 turns
 to
 leave
 the
 room
 and
 finds
 Gibbous
 standing
 at
 the
 entrance
 of
 the
 doorway
 Crying
 she
 explains
 everything
 She
 is
 a
 member
 of
 the
 League
 of
 Shadows
 
 and
 is
 forbidden
 from
 seeing
 other
 men
 She
 fears
 that
 the
 league
 will
 find
 out
 that
 he
 knows
 her
 secret
 track
 him
 down
 and
 kill
 both
 of
 them
 So
 in
 an
 attempt
 to
 hide
 in
 plain
 sight
 she
 offers
 him
 a
 job
 as
 an
 intern
 for
 the
 League
 He
 starts
 at
 the
 bottom
 of
 the
 totem
 pole
 
 mostly
 getting
 towels
 for
 other
 members
 and
 running
 small
 errands
 down
 to
 the
 village
 With
 time
 and
 through
 careful
 observation
 he
 learns
 a
 thing
 or
 
 about
 combat
 and
 becomes
 a
 master
 illusionist
 mostly
 just
 card
 tricks
 to
 entertain
 the
 other
 members
 to
 get
 them
 to
 like
 him
 though
 Eventually
 unable
 to
 bear
 the
 burden
 of
 not
 being
 together
 he
 and
 Gibbous
 sneak
 off
 and
 get
 married
 in
 a
 Taiwanese
 temple
 They
 return
 without
 anybody
 noticing
 their
 absence
 go
 to
 extreme
 measures
 to
 safeguard
 their
 secret
 
 until
 one
 night
 thinking
 themselves
 to
 be
 alone
 they
 get
 caught
 making
 out
 underneath
 a
 nightfloweringjasmine
 tree
 by
 a
 stargazing
 league
 member
 trying
 out
 his
 new
 telescope
 They
 flee
 narrowly
 escaping
 with
 their
 lives
 Knowing
 that
 its
 the
 one
 place
 the
 League
 would
 never
 look
 they
 make
 there
 way
 to
 Vineyard
 Utah
 With
 a
 revamped
 passion
 and
 purpose
 in
 life
 
 he
 decides
 to
 devote
 his
 existence
 to
 goodness
 assuming
 the
 alias
 of
 The
 Dart
 He
 wears
 an
 allblack
 outfit
 with
 a
 golden
 mask
 His
 weapon
 of
 choice
 is
 a
 blowdart
 which
 he
 can
 fire
 with
 pinpoint
 accuracy
 up
 to
 
 yards
 away
 When
 the
 situation
 warrants
 closequarter
 combat
 
 the
 blowdart
 separates
 into
 
 batons
 and
 his
 breath
 is
 used
 to
 deflect
 enemy
 punches
 His
 perch
 if
 you
 will
 is
 on
 top
 of
 the
 Maverick
 Gas
 Station
 where
 he
 navigates
 his
 surroundings
 and
 keeps
 the
 people
 of
 Vineyard
 safe
 His
 greatest
 nemesis
 is
 The
 Extinguisher
 Heres
 where
 things
 get
 interesting
 though
 The
 Dart
 is
 The
 Extinguisher
 Traumatized
 by
 his
 time
 in
 Nepal
 
 he
 has
 developed
 a
 split
 personality
 disorder
 that
 sporadically
 manifests
 itself
 as
 an
 unhealthy
 coping
 mechanism
 He
 is
 unaware
 of
 the

 and
 incognizant
 of
 his
 own
 malevolent
 nature
 Like
 the
 sportsman
 who
 finds
 gratification
 in
 the
 ache
 of
 muscle
 or
 the
 penitent
 sinner
 welcoming
 remorse
 of
 conscience
 in
 favor
 of
 apathy
 The
 Grassy
 Protuberance
 offers
 an
 ethereal
 retreat
 to
 those
 rarified
 individuals
 that
 find
 the
 perennial
 discomfort
 of
 solitude
 so
 so
 comforting
 Solitude
 not
 in
 a
 Material
 sense
 of
 the
 word
 but
 in
 a
 holistic
 one
 Mind
 Body
 and
 Soul
 Where
 the
 Ego
 slowly
 fades
 into
 nothingness
 and
 the
 threat
 of
 status
 disappears
 with
 the
 metaphorical
 lights
 and
 the
 cameras
 and
 the
 music
 And
 the
 individual
 
 the
 real
 individual
 
 finds
 himself
 alone
 With
 all
 his
 inherent
 shame
 bodily
 insecurities
 and
 repressed
 fears
 seeping
 into
 the
 conscious
 mind
 palace
 
 as
 the
 draw
 bridges
 of
 Routine
 are
 lowered
 and
 the
 Walls
 of
 Pride
 are
 scaled
 The
 prospect
 is
 daunting
 yes
 but
 it
 is
 only
 when
 sober
 that
 one
 understands
 drunkenness
 and
 only
 those
 who
 are
 awake
 understand
 the
 nature
 of
 sleep
 So
 set
 your
 alarms
 
 and
 discover
 the
 satiety
 of
 grassy
 seclusion
 The
 inspiration
 for
 the
 title
 came
 from
 a
 blog
 post
 of
 roughly
 the
 same
 name
 In
 it
 the
 author
 observes
 that
 although
 all
 of
 our
 contemporary
 actors
 and
 actresses
 are
 aesthetically
 beautiful
 
 they
 are
 strangely
 lacking
 in
 any
 real
 allure
 or
 sexual
 energy
 This
 rang
 true
 immediately
 Think
 about
 Marvel
 
 a
 good
 representative
 of
 popular
 culture
 In
 the
 obligatory
 shirtless
 reveal
 for
 every
 movie
 their
 bodies
 are
 literally
 perfect
 
 so
 why
 dont
 any
 of
 them
 feel
 sexy
 Ironically
 the
 character
 that
 exudes
 the
 most
 sexual
 energy
 RDJs
 IronMan
 is
 the
 least
 conventionally
 attractive
 of
 all
 the
 major
 heroes
 This
 blog
 isnt
 about
 Marvel
 and
 its
 not
 about
 being
 horny
 or
 having
 sex
 although
 its
 relevant
 and
 interesting
 that
 in
 the
 most
 openly
 sexual
 climate
 in
 human
 history
 nobody
 is
 actually
 having
 sex
 No
 instead
 I
 want
 to
 abstract
 out
 that
 core
 concept
 because
 I
 think
 its
 important
 Take
 Instagram
 for
 example
 and
 think
 about
 how
 meta
 its
 gotten
 The
 app
 used
 to
 be
 openly
 performative
 staged
 backgrounds
 obvious
 posing
 and
 intentional
 outfits
 which
 Im
 fine
 with
 btw
 Now
 however
 its
 taken
 things
 a
 step
 further
 
 with
 casual
 instagram
 being
 performativelynonperformative
 in
 the
 same
 way
 reality
 TV
 mimics
 real
 life
 Were
 signaling
 down
 to
 earth
 by
 staging
 meticulous
 casual
 candid
 photo
 dumps
 and
 it
 feels
 even
 more
 soulless
 than
 its
 predecessor
 Our
 Priests
 dont
 feel
 priestly
 our
 news
 outlets
 are
 liars
 our
 tiktokers
 are
 sexless
 and
 Taylor
 Swift
 
 our
 symbol
 of
 female
 empowerment
 
 is
 a
 lifeless
 marionette
 with
 
 people
 pulling
 the
 strings
 behind
 the
 scenes
 Sorry
 to
 drag
 Taylor
 into
 this
 Swifties
 Even
 politics
 
 the
 place
 where
 people
 seem
 the
 most
 passionate
 
 just
 feels
 like
 gutless
 posturing
 and
 feigned
 moral
 outrage
 I
 dont
 see
 people
 I
 see
 mouthpieces
 masquerading
 as
 people
 People
 dont
 have
 ideas
 ideas
 have
 people
 And
 finally
 theres
 sex
 What
 healthy
 models
 of
 sex
 do
 we
 have
 to
 turn
 to
 Everything
 is
 either
 pornographic
 or
 Hollywoodized
 I
 cant
 think
 of
 a
 single
 realistic
 sex
 scene
 is
 cinema
 The
 point
 Im
 trying
 to
 make
 is
 I
 feel
 like
 weve
 lost
 what
 makes
 us
 human
 Were
 really
 good
 at
 mimicking
 emotion
 
 or
 sexuality
 or
 piousness
 or
 creative
 thought
 
 and
 really
 bad
 at
 actually
 expressing
 it
 Were
 physically
 alive
 but
 spiritually
 dead
 theres
 a
 reason
 the
 zombie
 myth
 has
 taken
 such
 a
 grip
 on
 our
 culture
 Im
 projecting
 Im
 just
 as
 much
 of
 a
 vapid
 inauthentic
 virtuesignaler
 as
 the
 next
 guy
 but
 I
 dont
 want
 to
 be
 I
 dont
 ike
 feeling
 ike
 a
 xerox
 of
 a
 xerox
 This
 blog
 is
 going
 to
 be
 messy
 Even
 if
 it
 sucks
 its
 probably
 going
 to
 suck
 I
 hope
 it
 at
 least
 has
 a
 soul
 
 and
 isnt
 just
 a
 blog
 trying
 to
 be
 a
 blog
 To
 live
 is
 the
 rarest
 thing
 in
 the
 world
 most
 people
 just
 exist
 
 Oscar
 Wilde
 If
 you
 havent
 seen
 the
 Lego
 Batman
 Movie
 Stockton
 heres
 my
 most
 concise
 convincing
 argument
 for
 why
 you
 should
 Of
 all
 the
 contemporary
 films
 TLBM
 is
 the
 only
 one
 that
 gets
 the
 essence
 of
 the
 Batman
 mythos
 right
 Hero
 stories
 arent
 about
 superpowers
 Rather
 their
 slate
 of
 abilities
 stand
 as
 a
 foil
 for
 a
 superweakness
 At
 the
 heart
 of
 the
 Batman
 story
 behind
 the
 crimefighting
 and
 the
 gadgeting
 and
 the
 detectiving
 is
 a
 deeply
 broken
 individual
 struggling
 to
 cope
 with
 loss
 Batman
 is
 about
 loneliness
 Genius
 level
 IQ
 never
 ending
 money
 mastery
 of
 physical
 combat
 gorgeous
 looks
 
 all
 of
 these
 superficially
 nice
 character
 traits
 only
 serve
 to
 further
 distinguish
 him
 from
 the
 common
 man
 Batman
 was
 created
 to
 be
 more
 than
 flesh
 and
 blood
 Hes
 a
 symbol
 an
 idea
 In
 many
 ways
 Bruce
 is
 more
 alien
 than
 Superman
 Unable
 to
 let
 anyone
 in
 
 he
 dresses
 in
 all
 black
 only
 comes
 out
 at
 night
 and
 deals
 with
 his
 anger
 by
 beating
 Gothams
 criminal
 underworld
 to
 a
 pulp
 LBM
 gets
 this
 and
 it
 feels
 sooooo
 right
 Also
 the
 first
 
 minutes
 are
 about
 as
 hard
 as
 Ive
 ever
 laughed
 The
 jokes
 are
 so
 quick
 so
 clever
 Ive
 never
 seen
 a
 movie
 rapid
 fire
 quip
 after
 quip
 ike
 this
 one
 does
 rd
 act
 notwithstanding
 So
 if
 you
 havent
 seen
 it
 already
 Stockton
 please
 make
 it
 a
 priority
 A
 few
 entertainment
 tropes
 that
 I
 severely
 dislike
 
 When
 falling
 debris
 from
 a
 collapsing

 but
 doesnt
 fatally
 wound
 a
 character
 Please
 Theyre
 deader
 than
 a
 diabetic
 crashing
 on
 Willy
 Wonkas
 couch
 for
 the
 week
 
 To
 show
 us
 a
 character
 is
 cool
 and
 enviable
 they
 cut
 to
 himher
 surrounded
 by
 adoring
 peers
 
 drinks
 in
 hands
 
 telling
 the
 punchline
 of
 a
 joke
 we
 have
 no
 context
 for
 Its
 cheap
 its
 been
 done
 too
 many
 times
 and
 feels
 ike
 lazy
 writing
 compensating
 for
 the
 fact
 you
 cant
 actually
 write
 a
 funny
 joke
 that
 stands
 on
 its
 own
 
 I
 feel
 ike
 Im
 beating
 a
 dead
 horse
 at
 this
 point
 but
 laser
 tripwire
 security
 systems
 that
 are
 extremely
 difficult
 but
 not
 impossible
 to
 navigate
 if
 you
 are
 extremely
 agile
 Just
 make
 the
 thing
 actually
 impossible
 This
 should
 be
 a
 nobrainer
 but
 somehow
 jewel
 thiefs
 with
 grapnel
 guns
 and
 women
 in
 sexy
 black
 leather
 are
 bypassing
 these
 things
 left
 and
 right
 Is
 Veganism
 morally
 correct
 
 
 Eating
 animal

 is

 Optimizing
 human
 health
 is
 desirable
 as

 as
 it

 Eating
 animal
 food
 is
 desirable
 as
 long
 as

 Something
 is

 if
 it
 promotes
 an

 Veganism
 does

 Things
 that

 Veganism
 is
 not
 ethical
 eating
 animal
 foods
 is
 morally
 correct

 There
 are
 specific
 micronutrients
 that
 can

 be
 found
 in
 animal
 based
 products
 that
 are
 required
 for

 physical

 These
 include
 
 but
 are
 not

 to
 
 B
 creatine
 zinc
 hemeiron
 carnitine
 carnosine
 D
 DHA
 and

 The
 quantity
 and
 bioavailability
 of
 amino
 acids
 are
 also
 superior

 Supplementation
 does
 not
 have
 the

 effect
 therefore
 premise
 
 Few
 would
 subscribe
 to
 slavery
 even
 if
 it
 was
 proven
 to
 be
 the
 best
 economic
 system
 
 likewise
 eating
 animal
 products
 should
 be
 done
 only
 if
 it
 is
 ethical
 
 Mill
 said
 Actions
 are
 right
 in
 proportion
 as
 they
 tend
 to
 promote
 happiness
 wrong
 as
 they
 tend
 to
 produce
 the
 reverse
 By
 happiness
 is
 intended
 pleasure
 and
 the
 absence
 of
 pain
 by
 unhappiness
 pain
 and
 the
 privation
 of
 pleasure
 
 By
 depriving
 people
 of
 requisite
 nutrients
 and
 killing
 even
 more
 animals
 as
 a
 byproduct
 of
 crop
 harvesting
 Veganism
 decreases
 net
 utility
 by
 reducing
 net
 pleasure
 and
 increasing
 net
 pain
 
 
 
 
 The
 most
 likely
 objection
 would
 be
 premise
 
 Veganism
 argues
 that
 it
 reduces
 suffering
 This
 is
 wrong
 for
 
 reasons
 
 A
 bovine
 living
 a
 normal
 life
 with
 a
 moment
 of
 slight
 confusion
 and
 possible
 terror
 at
 the
 end
 
 is
 not
 morally
 comparable
 to
 selfconscious
 humans
 with
 a
 theory
 of
 mind
 suffering
 a
 lifetime
 of
 malnutrition
 anemia
 depression
 sarcopenia
 diabetes
 rheumatoid
 arthritis
 or
 Alzheimers
 Meat
 eating
 is
 anti
 human
 suffering
 
 Even
 if
 net
 suffering
 is
 disregarded
 and
 death
 count
 is
 the
 only
 thing
 taken
 into
 consideration
 Veganism
 kills
 more
 animals
 through
 ancillary
 methods
 than
 meateating
 does
 Tens
 of
 billions
 of
 bees
 are
 killed
 yearly
 to
 farm
 almonds
 in
 the
 US
 Millions
 of
 possums
 raccoons
 mice
 snakes
 rodents
 and
 rabbits
 are
 killed
 through
 the
 process
 of
 conventional
 grain
 harvesting
 Insects
 worms
 pests
 and
 bugs
 all
 have
 to
 be
 mitigated
 in
 order
 for
 crops
 to
 grow
 A
 carnivore
 might
 generously
 go
 through
 
 cows
 and
 
 chickens
 in
 a
 year
 A
 Vegan
 Somewhere
 north
 of
 
 animals
 
 Veganism
 is
 accidentally
 antilife
 The
 easiest
 way
 to
 reduce
 suffering
 is
 to
 stop
 existing
 Take
 its
 premises
 out
 to
 their
 logical
 conclusion
 and
 you
 get
 the
 Voluntary
 Human
 Extinction
 Vegan
 organization
 who
 believes
 that
 humans
 produce
 so
 much
 suffering
 to
 the
 planet
 that
 we
 should
 expurgate
 ourselves
 This
 is
 morally
 wrong
 and
 Veganism
 often
 skirts
 these
 types
 of
 arguments
 Addendum
 I
 used
 the
 premises
 that
 I
 did
 because
 most
 Vegan
 moralists
 make
 a
 utilitarian
 argument
 asserting
 that
 Veganism
 decreases
 net
 suffering
 However
 if
 youre
 not
 an
 ends
 justify
 the
 means
 type
 of
 person
 a
 Kantian
 argument
 could
 be
 made
 as
 well
 If
 faced
 with
 the
 option
 of
 starving
 to
 death
 or
 killing
 and
 eating
 a
 cow
 most
 would
 not
 find
 the
 latter
 morally
 objectionable
 
 Veganism
 is
 an
 increasingly
 growing
 movement
 and
 is
 particularly
 appealing
 to
 young
 people
 By
 adopting
 its
 principles
 under
 the
 false
 idea
 that
 it
 is
 morally
 superior
 many
 individuals
 are
 suffering
 through
 severe
 health
 conditions
 and
 accidentally
 killing
 more
 animals
 in
 the
 process
 Myers
 Briggs
 terminology
 needs
 to
 be
 stamped
 out
 of
 existence
 The
 
 letter
 shorthand
 has
 utility
 when
 trying
 to
 communicate
 a
 general
 personality
 type
 
 but
 the
 confusion
 and
 misdirection
 that
 comes
 from
 the
 horrendously
 labeled
 dichotomies
 is
 a
 nightmare
 To
 say
 nothing
 of
 the
 fact
 that
 there
 is
 no
 substantial
 evidence
 to
 support
 the
 idea
 of
 different
 cognitive
 functions
 
 lets
 focus
 exclusively
 on
 the
 vocabulary
 and
 why
 it
 is
 so
 problematic
 ThinkingFeeling
 Good
 hell
 that
 label
 is
 frustrating
 When
 you
 hear
 those
 two
 words
 you
 intuitively
 conceptualize
 intelligence
 fighting
 emotions
 for
 precedence
 over
 the
 human
 psyche
 This
 is
 wrong
 For
 a
 few
 reasons
 
 Youre
 conflating
 thinking
 with
 the
 Myers
 Briggs
 intuition
 N
 trait
 openness
 in
 Big
 
 model
 Fluency
 with
 ideas
 IQ
 creativity
 and
 intelligence
 are
 all
 accounted
 for
 in
 a
 different
 trait
 The
 Thinking
 trait
 has
 nothing
 to
 do
 with
 intelligence
 Ie
 your
 capacity
 to
 think
 has
 nothing
 to
 do
 with
 the
 thinking
 trait
 Under
 the
 Myers
 Briggs
 model
 you
 could
 have
 an
 idiot
 thinker
 and
 a
 brilliant
 feeler
 
 Most
 of
 the
 emotion
 that
 we
 experience
 is
 wound
 up
 in
 
 distinct
 traits
 extraversion
 and
 neuroticism
 The
 positive
 spectrum
 of
 emotion
 being
 associated
 with
 the
 former
 
 negative
 with
 the
 latter
 Considering
 positive
 and
 negative
 emotion
 covers
 most
 of
 the
 emotional
 spectrum
 its
 strange
 to
 conceptualize
 a
 trait
 as
 feeling
 when
 it
 has
 nothing
 to
 do
 with
 either
 of
 those
 Confused
 Yeah
 Heres
 the
 problem
 ThinkingFeeling
 in
 the
 Myers
 Briggs
 terminology
 is
 supposed
 to
 be
 describing
 the
 much
 better
 named
 AgreeableDisagreeable
 trait
 according
 to
 Big
 
 terminology
 Agreeable
 people
 are
 polite
 nonconfrontational
 and
 empathetic
 They
 tend
 to
 put
 others
 or
 the
 groups
 needs
 before
 their
 own
 Disagreeable
 people
 are
 blunt
 assertive
 and
 competitive
 They
 are
 more
 likely
 to
 advocate
 for
 themselves
 in
 a
 negotiation
 Why
 they
 would
 choose
 to
 conceptualize
 disagreeable
 as
 thinking
 and
 agreeable
 as
 feeling
 is
 beyond
 me
 
 Notice
 how
 its
 called
 the
 Big
 
 but
 Myers
 Briggs
 only
 has
 
 traits
 Despite
 Myers
 Briggs
 deriving
 its
 theory
 from
 the
 Big
 
 they
 chose
 to
 minimize
 one
 of
 the
 primary
 traits
 Neuroticism
 This
 dichotomy
 describes
 an
 individuals
 propensity
 to
 experience
 negative
 emotion
 anxiousness
 depression
 and
 anger
 
 with
 a
 low
 stress
 tolerance
 Its
 compliment
 could
 be
 conceptualized
 as
 emotional
 stability
 high
 stress
 tolerance
 and
 less
 likely
 to
 experience
 negative
 emotion
 Ignoring
 this
 trait
 is
 a
 mistake
 It
 massively
 informs
 our
 understanding
 of
 the
 individual
 in
 question
 Neuroticism
 underpins
 all
 of
 the
 other
 traits
 Highly
 neurotic
 individuals
 have
 the
 tendency
 to
 withdraw
 Without
 an
 understanding
 of
 neuroticism
 you
 could
 conflate
 this
 with
 introversion
 Similarly
 because
 anxious
 people
 view
 novel
 situations
 more
 threateningly
 their
 shoveoff
 defense
 mechanisms
 could
 be
 conflated
 with
 disagreeableness
 and
 their
 depressed
 lack
 of
 motivation
 could
 be
 undeservedly
 mixed
 up
 with
 low
 conscientiousness

 What
 do
 you

 Look
 With
 questions
 like
 this
 there
 are
 always
 definitional
 
 semantical
 problems
 that
 inform
 your
 decision
 Whats
 the
 terrain
 Can
 you
 command
 the
 animals
 defending
 you
 Do
 you
 yourself
 have
 any
 weapons
 Etc
 etc
 etc
 Heres
 the
 thing
 though
 Whichever
 whatever
 way
 you
 slice
 it
 theres
 only
 
 correct
 answer
 here
 Rats
 and
 eagles
 
 Do
 you
 realize
 how
 many
 
 is
 Picture
 your
 entire
 high
 school
 out
 on
 the
 football
 field
 for
 firedrill
 simulations
 then
 multiply
 that
 number
 by
 
 Putting
 their
 protective
 capabilities
 aside
 you
 have
 to
 pick
 the
 rats
 solely
 based
 on
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 could
 never
 survive
 that
 swarm
 Now
 their
 teeth
 are
 pretty
 strong
 All
 it
 would
 take
 is
 a
 couple
 strong
 bites
 to
 the
 achilles
 and
 that
 would
 mostly
 mitigate
 the
 slower
 moving
 land
 mammals
 Where
 they
 would
 run
 into
 trouble
 would
 be
 the
 gators
 because
 of
 their
 tough
 exterior
 and
 the
 lionswolves
 because
 of
 how
 fast
 they
 are
 Their
 best
 shot
 on
 the
 gators
 would
 either
 be
 to
 go
 for
 the
 eyes
 or
 sacrifice
 yourself
 and
 try
 to
 suffocatechoke
 them
 Picking
 the
 eagles
 similar
 to
 the
 rats
 is
 mostly
 a
 matter
 of
 not
 having
 them
 on
 the
 other
 side
 Rats
 wouldnt
 be
 able
 to
 guard
 against
 an
 aerial
 attack
 
 and
 a
 few
 eagles
 could
 take
 down
 a
 human
 pretty
 easily
 They
 would
 be
 useful
 in
 safeguarding
 against
 the
 lions
 and
 wolves
 They
 wouldnt
 need
 to
 kill
 them
 
 just
 go
 for
 the
 eyes
 rendering
 them
 useless
 Youre
 in
 for
 a
 tough
 time
 no
 matter
 who
 you
 pick
 but
 no
 group
 could
 defend
 you
 from
 
 bloodthirsty
 rodents
 
 and
 aerial
 attacks
 would
 be
 a
 nightmare
 
 so
 rats
 and
 eagles
 is
 the
 best
 way
 to
 hedge
 your
 bets

 that
 hes
 been
 put
 in
 Given
 the
 nature
 of
 his
 powers
 he
 has
 a
 perennial
 feeling
 of
 shame
 anytime
 he
 isnt
 eating
 How
 could
 he
 be
 so
 selfish
 to
 hang
 out
 with
 friends
 play
 video
 games
 or
 even
 sleep
 
 when
 he
 could
 be
 saving
 the
 lives
 of
 starving
 children
 Even
 if
 hes
 feeling
 an
 enormous
 burden
 of
 responsibility
 at
 least
 he
 can
 eat
 whatever
 he
 wants
 right
 Maybe
 The
 problem
 is
 obviously
 everything
 he
 eats
 is
 getting
 sent
 to
 little
 kids
 While
 he
 could
 certainly
 blackout
 in
 a
 cake
 ice
 cream
 and
 cookies
 sugar
 coma
 
 the
 fact
 that
 thats
 the
 nutrition
 starving
 children
 will
 be
 receiving
 is
 always
 in
 the
 back
 of
 his
 mind
 Is
 it
 morally
 reprehensible
 to
 damage
 others
 in
 his
 hedonistic
 pursuit
 of
 pleasure
 Like
 any
 stimulus
 the
 signal
 becomes
 weaker
 as
 it
 is
 chronically
 overused
 Higher
 doses
 in
 higher
 frequencies
 are
 required
 to
 receive
 the
 same

 Food
 dictates
 his
 life
 
 so
 by
 that
 token
 the
 dopaminergic
 system
 is
 downregulated
 and
 it
 begins
 to
 lose
 its
 pleasure
 Eating
 becomes
 a
 chore
 
 done
 out
 of
 pure
 virtuous
 duty
 Does
 he
 ever
 find
 the
 line
 balancing
 taking
 care
 of
 his
 own
 needs
 and
 those
 he
 feels
 are
 under

 stewardship
 No

 they
 take

 he

 during

 and
 as
 soon
 as
 the

 the

 regains

 miserable
 He
 has
 no

 in

 its
 incredibly
 difficult
 to
 maintain
 any

 of
 long
 standing

 and
 most
 of
 the
 time
 he
 just
 wakes
 up
 in
 a
 foreign
 culture
 where
 he
 doesnt
 speak
 the

 and
 doesnt
 really
 know
 how
 to
 navigate
 his

 He
 learns
 to
 pool
 resources
 from
 different

 into
 a
 singular
 account
 
 while
 simultaneously
 trying
 to
 do
 as
 much
 damage
 as
 possible
 to
 the

 life
 in
 the
 short

 he
 is
 there
 His

 in

 is
 to

 This
 paper
 illustrates
 many
 of
 the
 problems
 encountered
 when
 uncovering
 the
 data
 used
 to
 set
 recommended
 daily
 allowances
 Given
 these
 obstacles
 the
 author
 argues
 that
 the
 RDAs
 are
 neither
 sacrosanct
 nor
 immutable
 but
 represent
 an
 informed
 judgement
 of
 current
 experiential
 data
 and
 everyday
 experience
 One
 of
 the
 primary
 premises
 that
 he
 offers
 in
 defense
 of
 this
 argument
 is
 the
 high
 degree
 of
 variation
 among
 individuals
 Ignoring
 the
 massive
 variability
 between
 groups
 sex
 age
 ethnicity
 there
 is
 still
 substantial
 variability
 among
 individuals
 This
 will
 be
 useful
 in
 defending
 and
 illustrating
 Russels
 third
 point
 namely
 that
 there
 is
 an
 erroneous
 assumption
 in
 the
 homoscedasticity
 among
 individuals
 particularly
 children
 Downing
 attempts
 to
 evaluate
 the
 RDAs
 using
 two
 primary
 questions
 first
 are
 they
 valid
 Secondly
 are
 they
 being
 achieved
 The
 author
 does
 not
 at
 least
 in
 this
 article
 go
 into
 depth
 on
 the
 first
 question
 Rather
 they
 aim
 to
 answer
 the
 second
 question
 are
 individuals
 meeting
 the
 requirements
 outlined
 by
 the
 recommended
 daily
 allowances
 Downing
 postulates
 that
 the
 answer
 is
 a
 resounding
 no
 He
 then
 goes
 on
 to
 list
 several
 studies
 exemplifying
 this
 fact
 and
 then
 gives
 a
 few
 reasons
 why
 he
 suspects
 this
 to
 be
 case
 Considering
 already
 have
 a
 plethora
 of
 articles
 to
 answer
 the
 first
 question
 are
 they
 valid
 this
 article
 is
 useful
 in
 demonstrating
 the
 habits
 of
 consumers
 This
 article
 focuses
 primarily
 on
 the
 correlation
 between
 cardiovascular
 risk
 factors
 and
 nutrition
 behaviors
 between
 both
 children
 and
 adults
 Specifically
 it
 looks
 at
 the
 percentage
 of
 certain
 macro
 and
 micro
 nutrients
 in
 relation
 to
 percentage
 of
 total
 caloric
 intake
 along
 with
 the
 accompanying
 biological
 and
 physiological
 markers
 The
 article
 then
 goes
 on
 to
 make
 recommendations
 for
 adequate
 intakes
 and
 proportions
 of
 certain
 micro
 and
 macronutrients
 Although
 I
 wont
 focus
 explicitly
 on
 cardiovascular
 disease
 this
 article
 will
 be
 useful
 in
 the
 treatment
 of
 endpoints
 that
 should
 be
 focused
 on
 when
 regarding
 recommended
 daily
 allowances
 Likewise
 this
 is
 emblematic
 of
 the
 type
 of
 recommendations
 that
 are
 being
 given
 to
 individuals
 as
 well
 as
 their
 underlying
 theory
 Hegsted
 offers
 thorough
 critiques
 of
 the
 second
 objection
 that
 Russell
 posed
 in
 his
 article
 Setting
 dietary
 intake
 levels
 problems
 and
 pitfalls
 namely
 that
 the
 recommended
 daily
 allowances
 do
 not
 adequately
 define
 what
 the
 useful
 endpoints
 are
 when
 evaluating
 sufficient
 intake
 of
 certain
 nutrients
 Specifically
 he
 questions
 the
 RDAs
 primarily
 semantic
 definitions
 of
 words
 like
 goals
 groups
 good
 and
 people
 This
 article
 will
 be
 useful
 in
 establishing
 the
 flaws
 in
 theory
 underlying
 the
 recommendations
 as
 well
 as
 further
 strengthening
 the
 critique
 made
 by
 Russell
 This
 article
 speaks
 extensively
 about
 the
 origin
 of
 the
 dietary
 recommendations
 particularly
 the
 context
 surrounding
 why
 the
 movement
 was
 catalyzed
 in
 the
 first
 place
 It
 details
 the
 process
 for
 defining
 the
 recommended
 daily
 allowances
 speaks
 to
 the
 definitions
 involved
 makes
 note
 of
 the
 requisite
 criteria
 and
 finishes
 by
 commenting
 on
 how
 pharmacological
 substances
 could
 affect
 these
 recommendations
 Although
 pharmacology
 and
 criteria
 will
 not
 be
 treated
 in
 my
 work
 the
 process
 for
 defining
 the
 RDAs
 as
 well
 as
 the
 definitions
 involved
 will
 be
 tremendously
 useful
 in
 evaluating
 the
 endpoint
 problem
 outlined
 by
 Russell
 The
 purpose
 of
 this
 article
 is
 to
 try
 and
 assess
 the
 optimal
 diet
 and
 recommending
 it
 to
 individuals
 that
 maximizes
 a
 low
 probability
 of
 deficiencies
 while
 avoiding
 going
 over
 the
 UL
 upper
 intake
 level
 for
 certain
 nutrients
 The
 article
 goes
 into
 a
 considerable
 amount
 of
 depth
 attempting
 to
 identify
 the
 correct
 diet
 showing
 several
 graphs
 and
 flowcharts
 In
 particular
 it
 goes
 into
 depth
 about
 the
 methodology
 to
 develop
 recommended
 dietary
 allowances
 adequate
 intake
 and
 upper
 intake
 levels
 Then
 it
 takes
 about
 energy
 intakes
 in
 terms
 of
 helping
 individuals
 maintain
 or
 lose
 body
 fat
 which
 is
 another
 relevant
 endpoint
 that
 should
 be
 taken
 into
 consideration
 when
 determining
 recommended
 daily
 allowances
 and
 the
 effect
 that
 they
 have
 on
 individuals
 This
 article
 focuses
 primarily
 on
 the
 micronutrient
 inadequacies

 the
 United
 States

 and

 cross
 references
 data
 from
 national
 data
 surveys
 across
 the
 US
 in
 order
 to
 determine
 how
 well
 individuals
 are
 eating
 and
 what
 can
 be
 done
 to
 combat
 nutrient
 deficiencies
 The
 article
 is
 thorough
 providing
 several
 charts
 to
 illustrate
 mean
 daily
 intakes
 from
 natural
 food
 mean
 daily
 intakes
 including
 enrichments
 and
 EARs
 when
 accounting
 for
 all
 sources
 of
 nutrients
 This
 will
 be
 useful
 in
 identifying
 how
 well
 given
 the
 recommended
 daily
 allowances
 individuals
 in
 the
 US
 have
 been
 able
 or
 are
 motivated
 to
 follow
 them
 This
 article
 is
 primarily
 arguing
 that
 the
 recommended
 daily
 allowances
 are
 preferable
 to
 the
 EARs
 estimated
 average
 requirements
 and
 should
 be
 used
 on
 nutrition
 labels
 Though
 this
 comparison
 is
 not
 particularly
 useful
 to
 the
 subject
 of
 work
 at
 hand
 it
 does
 dive
 extensively
 into
 the
 behavior
 of
 how
 consumers
 interact
 with
 nutrition
 labels
 Understanding
 individual
 interpretations
 and
 the
 teleological
 role
 that
 RDAs
 are
 actually
 playing
 in
 the
 real
 world
 will
 be
 useful
 in
 determining
 whether
 or
 not
 they
 need
 to
 be
 adjusted
 Recommended
 Dietary
 Allowances
 th
 Edition
 will
 arguably
 be
 the
 most
 important
 reference
 in
 this
 literature
 review
 Considering
 this
 is
 the
 primary
 determinant
 in
 the
 implementation
 of
 the
 recommended
 daily
 allowances
 significant
 insight
 can
 be
 gained
 by
 its
 careful
 study
 The
 underlying
 theory
 of
 the
 RDAs
 how
 they
 first
 originated
 the
 methodology
 by
 which
 they
 were
 established
 how
 they
 have
 evolved
 over
 the
 years
 and
 where
 they
 stand
 today
 are
 all
 treated
 in
 this
 book
 This
 article
 identifies
 the
 primary
 issues
 that
 individuals
 take
 with
 the
 Recommended
 Daily
 Allowances
 that
 have
 been
 established
 as
 a
 whole
 The
 authors
 identify
 
 objections
 that
 they
 find
 problemation
 
 They
 claim
 the
 assumption
 that
 there
 is
 a
 threshold
 level
 to
 each
 for
 each
 nutrient
 is
 invalid
 
 The
 RDAs
 lack
 a
 uniform
 criteria
 for
 how
 to
 evaluate
 the
 byproducts
 of
 sufficient
 nutrients
 as
 good
 
 They
 erroneously
 extrapolate
 the
 nutrient
 needs
 of
 different
 groups
 such
 as
 children

 and
 the
 elderly
 
 We
 seriously
 lack

 Individuals
 in
 the
 general
 community
 do
 not
 sufficiently
 understand
 how
 to
 use
 the
 recommendations
 This
 literature
 review
 seeks
 to
 answer
 the
 questions
 raised
 by
 experts
 in
 the
 nutrition
 dietetics
 and
 epidemiological
 fields
 surrounding
 the
 Recommended
 Daily
 Allowances
 Specifically
 it
 is
 interested
 in
 whether
 or
 not
 the
 RDAs
 serve
 as
 both
 valid
 and
 reliable
 barometers
 for
 appropriate
 nutrient
 intake
 There
 is
 currently
 no
 consensus
 among
 those
 studying
 the
 subject
 most
 thoroughly
 so
 this
 review
 draws
 from
 multiple
 competing
 sources
 and
 attempts
 to
 synthesize
 the
 primary
 points
 as
 well
 as
 formulate
 a
 solution
 A
 working
 version
 of
 the
 recommended
 daily
 allowances
 have
 been
 in
 place
 since
 the
 s
 and
 are
 the
 standard
 metric
 for
 individuals
 trying
 to
 gauge
 their
 nutrient
 sufficiency
 The
 primary
 objections
 to
 their
 utility
 are
 usually
 the
 methodology
 by
 which
 they
 were
 derived
 specifically
 epidemiological
 studies
 and
 nutrition
 surveys
 Given
 these
 tactics
 the
 ultimate
 idea
 in
 question
 
 and
 the
 one
 that
 this
 literature
 review
 strives
 to
 answer
 
 is
 whether
 or
 not
 value
 can
 be
 derived
 from
 data
 rife
 with
 methodological
 red
 flags
 Though
 other
 objections
 have
 been
 raised
 this
 review
 will
 focus
 most
 heavily
 on
 epidemiology
 how
 it
 works
 its
 upsides
 and
 its
 potential
 pitfalls
 After
 addressing
 methodology
 and
 epidemiology
 this
 article
 then
 seeks
 to
 answer
 questions
 surrounding
 the
 variability
 in
 nutrient
 intake
 among
 groups
 and
 then
 the
 Everybody
 is
 interested
 in
 food
 Given
 most
 individuals
 typically
 eat
 
 times
 per
 day
 a
 considerable
 amount
 of
 time
 and
 energy
 is
 spent
 into
 planning
 preparing
 and
 eating
 our
 meals
 Although
 food
 can
 be
 eaten
 for
 pleasure
 utilized
 for
 social
 functions
 or
 to
 fulfill
 creative
 needs
 it
 has
 always
 maintained
 two
 primary
 purposes
 
 a
 source
 of
 energy
 
 a
 source
 of
 nutrients
 Properly
 regulating
 our
 intake
 of
 foods
 that
 fulfill
 these
 two
 fundamental
 points
 and
 those
 foods
 that
 do
 not
 is
 in
 the
 best
 interest
 of
 any
 individual
 trying
 to
 maximize
 their
 own
 wellbeing
 To
 this
 end
 the
 first
 edition
 of
 Recommended
 Daily
 Allowances
 RDAs
 was
 published
 in
 
 in
 an
 attempt
 to
 quantify
 the
 ideal
 amount
 of
 each
 macro
 and
 micronutrient
 that
 we
 should
 be
 consuming
 every
 day
 Although
 nutrition
 science
 has
 advanced
 considerably
 since
 the
 s
 the
 same
 basic
 framework
 is
 still
 used
 in
 the
 United
 States
 today
 Unsurprisingly
 considering
 how
 difficult
 dietetic
 research
 is
 there
 is
 a
 considerable
 controversy
 surrounding
 the
 RDAs
 and
 their
 effectiveness
 The
 goal
 of
 this
 article
 is
 to
 review
 the
 relevant
 literature
 surrounding
 the
 underlying
 methodology
 and
 implementation
 of
 the
 RDAs
 and
 try
 to
 come
 to
 a
 consensus
 as
 to
 whether
 or
 not
 they
 serve
 as
 useful
 barometers
 for
 dietary
 preferences
 Understanding
 nutritional
 requirements
 and
 communicating
 them
 in
 an
 effective
 way
 to
 the
 general
 public
 is
 vital
 Cardiovascular
 disease
 is
 on
 the
 rise
 diabetes
 is
 on
 the
 rise
 and
 every
 other
 relevant
 marker
 of
 metabolic
 syndrome
 is
 also
 on
 the
 rise
 We
 not
 only
 need
 a
 better
 scientific
 representation
 of
 RDAs
 but
 we
 need
 more
 efficient
 and
 intuitive
 mediums
 to
 relay
 this
 information
 to
 the
 general
 public
 This
 literature
 review
 focuses
 on
 four
 primary
 objections
 to
 the
 RDAs
 many
 of
 which
 were
 outlined
 by
 Russel
 in
 his
 treatment
 of
 the
 subject
 Russell
 
 The
 methodology
 epidemiology
 regarding
 how
 the
 allowances
 are
 derived
 is
 faulty
 
 We
 seriously
 lack
 information
 on
 the
 confounding
 factors
 of
 epidemiology
 
 There
 is
 massive
 variation
 of
 needs
 between
 both
 groups
 and
 individuals
 
 Relevant
 endpoints
 have
 not
 been
 established
 when
 evaluating
 that
 a
 sufficient
 amount
 has
 been
 met
 
 Interaction
 between
 certain
 nutrients
 confounds
 findings
 Nutrition
 scientists
 have
 been
 interested
 in
 optimizing
 health
 ever
 since
 the
 inception
 of
 the
 study
 The
 first
 codified
 guide
 for
 nutrition
 intake
 was
 established
 in
 
 during
 World
 War
 II
 by
 the
 Food
 and
 Nutrition
 board
 They
 named
 this
 outline
 Recommended
 Dietary
 Allowances
 and
 the
 basic
 structure
 of
 those
 recommendations
 is
 still
 maintained
 to
 this
 day
 By
 evaluating
 the
 underlying
 theory
 involved
 in
 establishing
 the
 RDAs
 during
 their
 genesis
 we
 can
 establish
 whether
 or
 not
 they
 serve
 as
 a
 secure
 foundation
 for
 adequate
 nutrition
 The
 reason
 the
 context
 of
 World
 War
 II
 is
 important
 is
 because
 the
 guidelines
 were
 originally
 developed
 to
 determine
 in
 a
 time
 of
 possible
 shortage
 what
 levels
 of
 nutrients
 were
 required
 to
 ensure
 that
 the
 nutrition
 of
 the
 people
 would
 be
 safeguarded
 Mangino
 Its
 noteworthy
 to
 observe
 that
 the
 Food
 and
 Nutrition
 Boards
 intent
 was
 not
 to
 maximize
 health
 but
 to
 avoid
 sickness
 On
 the
 surface
 this
 could
 seem
 problematic
 and
 it
 is
 a
 common
 criticism
 leveled
 at
 the
 RDAs
 However
 upon
 closer
 examination
 the
 criticism
 seems
 to
 be
 unfounded
 or
 at
 the
 very
 least
 minimally
 important
 According
 to
 the
 Institute
 of
 Medicine
 It
 is
 evident
 that
 as
 early
 as
 
 an
 RDA
 committee
 was
 considering
 the
 potential
 health
 benefits
 of
 nutrient
 intakes
 above
 minimum
 requirements
 Institute
 of
 Medicine
 Although
 originally
 intending
 to
 solely
 stave
 off
 inadequate
 intake
 the
 Food
 and
 Nutrition
 board
 acknowledged
 the
 potential
 pitfalls
 of
 this
 methodology
 In
 response
 they
 broadened
 their
 mission
 to
 provide
 standards
 to
 serve
 as
 a
 goal
 for
 good
 nutrition
 NRC
 The
 board
 never
 claims
 to
 give
 advice
 for
 perfect
 nutrition
 and
 and
 intentionally
 included
 recommendation
 as
 part
 of
 its
 nomenclature
 Ultimately
 this
 is
 something
 that
 should
 be
 taken
 into
 consideration
 though
 not
 to
 be
 deemed
 too
 problematic
 The
 far
 more
 compelling
 question
 is
 in
 regard
 to
 how
 the
 Food
 and
 Nutrition
 board
 actually
 established
 the
 levels
 of
 adequate
 nutrition
 in
 the
 first
 place
 The
 primary
 medium
 used
 to
 study
 individuals
 in
 order
 to
 determine
 recommended
 daily
 allowances
 was
 epidemiology
 The
 primary
 stated
 goal
 of
 epidemiological
 inquiries
 is
 the
 distribution
 and
 determinants
 of
 healthrelated
 states
 or
 events
 and
 the
 application
 of
 this
 study
 to
 the
 control
 of
 health
 problems
 Principles
 of
 Epidemiology
 Epidemiology
 is
 conducted
 through
 observational
 studies
 The
 data
 for
 these
 studies
 is
 collected
 through
 various
 methods
 nutrition
 surveys
 and
 data
 mining
 being
 the
 most
 common
 After
 collecting
 and
 cleaning
 the
 data
 analysis
 and
 statistical
 inference
 is
 then
 performed
 The
 exact
 methods
 are
 outlined
 by
 the
 Food
 and
 Nutrition
 board
 Though
 epidemiology
 is
 a
 datadriven
 discipline
 that
 utilizes
 scientific
 inquiry
 to
 demonstrate
 its
 findings
 it
 comes
 with
 a
 myriad
 of
 problems
 that
 make
 accurate
 statistical
 inference
 incredibly
 difficult
 The
 first
 thing
 that
 should
 be
 noted
 is
 that
 epidemiology
 holds
 no
 causal
 or
 explanatory
 power
 Farmer
 identifies
 this
 in
 his
 criticism
 of
 the
 subject
 The
 proper
 way
 to
 draw
 inference
 in
 the
 scientific
 discipline
 is
 to
 posit
 a
 hypothesis
 set
 up
 an
 experiment
 control
 for
 confounding
 factors
 and
 infer
 results
 Due
 to
 the
 nature
 of
 observational
 studies
 no
 treatments
 are
 actually
 being
 performed
 on
 a
 subject
 Instead
 epidemiology
 works
 backwards
 observing
 the
 results
 and
 then
 inferring
 the
 treatments
 This
 makes
 isolating
 causal
 factors
 nearly
 impossible
 which
 is
 detrimental
 when
 attempting
 to
 evaluate
 nutritional
 need
 In
 fairness
 to
 epidemiology
 there
 are
 certain
 disciplines
 that
 attempt
 to
 control
 for
 these
 limitations
 For
 example
 the
 American
 Journal
 of
 Ophthalmology
 correctly
 identifies
 that
 many
 diseases
 are
 composed
 of
 multiple
 components
 none
 of
 which
 can
 be
 identified
 as
 the
 sole
 cause
 Rather
 it
 is
 a
 mosaic
 of
 components
 acting
 together
 though
 not
 necessarily
 contemporaneously
 that
 are
 required
 to
 produce
 disease
 Figure
 
 below
 represents
 using
 this
 strain
 of
 thinking
 in
 order
 to
 identify
 a
 potential
 culprit
 for
 disease
 Factor
 A
 appears
 in
 
 of
 the
 observations
 whereas
 factor
 B
 appears
 in
 
 and
 factor
 G
 only
 appears
 in
 
 suggesting
 Factor
 A
 is
 more
 likely
 to
 be
 causal
 Another
 response
 to
 the
 criticism
 of
 causation
 may
 be
 that
 although
 causation
 may
 not
 be
 technically
 inferred
 the
 findings
 may
 still
 be
 teleologically
 useful
 In
 other
 words
 the
 more
 scientific
 or
 logical
 definitions
 of
 causation
 seek
 to
 explain
 the
 world
 whereas
 a
 goal
 of
 epidemiology
 is
 more
 practical
 that
 is
 to
 inform
 public
 health
 efforts
 to
 reduce
 morbidity
 and
 mortality
 McGwin
 Although
 both
 of
 these
 objections
 are
 a
 step
 in
 the
 right
 direction
 the
 various
 methods
 to
 try
 to
 ameliorate
 the
 problem
 ultimately
 fail
 The
 heart
 of
 the
 issue
 causation
 still
 isnt
 properly
 addressed
 With
 so
 many
 confounding
 factors
 teleological
 arguments
 are
 dangerous
 Likewise
 when
 we
 are
 dealing
 with
 something
 as
 serious
 as
 nutritional
 requirements
 randomized
 control
 trials
 should
 be
 the
 gold
 standard
 The
 reason
 that
 proof
 of
 causation
 is
 so
 critical
 when
 dealing
 with
 dietetics
 and
 food
 nutrition
 is
 because
 there
 is
 a
 myriad
 of
 confounding
 factors
 that
 muddy
 that
 data
 Taubes
 speaks
 to
 this
 issue
 bluntly
 in
 his
 writings
 on
 the
 pitfalls
 of
 epidemiology
 Many
 epidemiologists
 concede
 that
 their
 studies
 are
 so
 plagued
 with
 biases
 uncertainties
 and
 methodological
 weaknesses
 that
 they
 may
 be
 inherently
 incapable
 of
 accurately
 discerning
 such
 weak
 associations
 Taubes
 There
 are
 a
 multitude
 of
 confounding
 factors
 when
 considering
 epidemiological
 studies
 However
 the
 treatment
 of
 just
 
 will
 be
 sufficient
 for
 this
 literature
 review
 
 Reporting
 issues
 
 Interactions
 between
 different
 factors
 Bad
 data
 will
 always
 lead
 to
 bad
 results
 and
 the
 data
 that
 we
 use
 to
 evaluate
 the
 RDAs
 and
 answer
 most
 dietetic
 problems
 in
 general
 is
 saturated
 with
 problems
 The
 statistics
 we
 are
 interested
 in
 studying
 in
 a
 population
 are
 typically
 ascertained
 through
 food
 questionnaires
 There
 are
 a
 few
 reasons
 this
 is
 problematic
 the
 first
 of
 which
 being
 that
 memory
 is
 fallible
 Its
 absurd
 to
 expect
 precision
 and
 therefore
 reliability
 when
 asking
 individuals
 questions
 such
 as
 How
 many
 bananas
 have
 you
 eaten
 in
 the
 last
 month
 or
 Over
 the
 course
 of
 the
 last
 six
 months
 how
 often
 did
 you
 consume
 
 teaspoons
 of
 sugar
 Pictured
 below
 in
 figure
 
 is
 a
 good
 representation
 of
 a
 typical
 nutrition
 survey
 demonstrating
 the
 obvious
 potential
 equivocations
 Unsurprisingly
 this
 is
 reflected
 in
 the
 literature
 Inaccurate
 recall
 underreporting
 of
 unhealthy
 foods
 and
 survey
 biases
 all
 contribute
 to
 faulty
 data
 For
 example
 Bedard
 found
 that
 Energy
 intake
 determined
 from
 selfreported
 dietary
 assessment
 methods
 may
 be
 underreported
 Bedard
 This
 is
 problematic
 because
 as
 Livingstone
 noted
 on
 her
 treatment
 of
 nutrition
 surveys
 Livingstons
 When
 poor
 data
 is
 gathered
 through
 nutritional
 assessments
 riddled
 with
 biases
 and
 then
 evaluated
 using
 shaky
 epidemiological
 methodologies
 
 trying
 to
 infer
 causation
 through
 corollary
 statistics
 
 you
 are
 unlikely
 to
 get
 useful
 results
 All
 recommended
 daily
 allowances
 were
 based
 on
 this
 type
 of
 science
 This
 is
 extremely
 problematic
 when
 deciding
 whether
 or
 not
 the
 RDAs
 serve
 as
 accurate
 and
 useful
 metrics
 The
 other
 problem
 that
 should
 be
 considered
 when
 evaluating
 epidemiological
 data
 is
 confounding
 factors
 This
 encompasses
 
 separate
 things
 both
 dietary
 confounding
 factors
 and
 nondietary
 confounding
 factors
 The
 former
 will
 be
 treated
 elsewhere
 in
 this
 review
 whereas
 the
 latter
 will
 be
 evaluated
 here
 Recall
 that
 the
 method
 by
 which
 the
 RDAs
 were
 established
 was
 by
 selecting
 healthy
 people
 who
 represent
 the
 segment
 of
 the
 population
 for
 which
 allowances
 were
 to
 be
 set
 determining
 the
 average
 requirement
 and
 then
 calculating
 an
 allowance
 to
 cover
 their
 needs
 Institute
 of
 Medicine
 The
 problem
 with
 this
 methodology
 is
 there
 are
 a
 multitude
 of
 nondietary
 factors
 that
 could
 qualify
 an
 individual
 as
 healthy
 People
 that
 exercise
 sleep
 dont
 smoke
 tobacco
 or
 drink
 alcohol
 are
 all
 going
 to
 be
 healthier
 individuals
 which
 confounds
 the
 dietary
 component
 and
 makes
 isolating
 the
 nutrient
 we
 are
 interested
 in
 difficult
 This
 is
 known
 as
 the
 Healthy
 User
 Bias
 and
 it
 can
 not
 only
 incorrectly
 show
 exaggerated
 correlation
 but
 sometimes
 it
 can
 go
 so
 far
 as
 to
 report
 results
 that
 contradict
 randomized
 control
 trials
 Shrank
 et
 al
 studied
 this
 phenomenon
 extensively
 explaining
 numerous
 highly
 publicized
 observational
 studies
 of
 the
 effect
 of
 prevention
 on
 health
 outcomes
 have
 reported
 exaggerated
 relationships
 that
 were
 later
 contradicted
 by
 randomized
 controlled
 trials
 Shrank
 This
 is
 a
 crucial
 criticism
 of
 observational
 data
 the
 heart
 of
 RDA
 establishment
 and
 one
 that
 we
 have
 yet
 to
 find
 a
 good
 solution
 for
 Each
 of
 us
 intuitively
 understands
 that
 some
 foods
 are
 nutritionally
 better
 than
 other
 foods
 Better
 is
 doing
 a
 lot
 of
 heavy
 lifting
 in
 that
 sentence
 though
 Better
 in
 what
 way
 Without
 a
 parameter
 that
 specifies
 what
 we
 are
 measuring
 propositions
 like
 X
 food
 is
 healthier
 than
 Y
 food
 dont
 make
 much
 sense
 Likewise
 its
 impossible
 to
 determine
 what
 the
 optimal
 nutrient
 intake
 should
 be
 without
 some
 sort
 of
 hierarchical
 metric
 This
 problem
 is
 openly
 admitted
 by
 the
 National
 Research
 Council
 This
 need
 for
 specificity
 further
 exacerbates
 the
 problem
 with
 the
 Food
 and
 Nutrition
 Boards
 original
 idea
 to
 find
 healthy
 individuals
 study
 their
 nutrition
 habits
 and
 then
 extract
 out
 the
 results
 There
 is
 no
 clear
 consensus
 as
 to
 what
 constitutes
 healthy
 even
 from
 a
 comprehensive
 perspective
 Meanwhile
 it
 becomes
 increasingly
 difficult
 when
 trying
 to
 pinpoint
 a
 specific
 micronutrient
 In
 contemplating
 this
 dilemma
 Kaaks
 suggests
 certain
 biological
 and
 physiological
 markers
 Specifically
 he
 argued
 Biochemical
 markers
 are
 increasingly
 seen
 as
 measurements
 that
 may
 help
 to
 overcome
 some
 of
 the
 methodological
 problems
 in
 nutritional
 epidemiology
 In
 practice
 this
 would
 involve
 determining
 what
 a
 good
 and
 bad
 biochemical
 metric
 for
 a
 specific
 micronutrient
 would
 be
 gathering
 samples
 from
 the
 population
 youd
 like
 to
 study
 and
 then
 correlating
 the
 metric
 with
 the
 purported
 nutrient
 intake
 This
 works
 in
 theory
 but
 is
 incredibly
 difficult
 in
 practice
 Take
 cyanocobalamin
 Vitamin
 B
 for
 example
 Weve
 observed
 that
 individuals
 with
 low
 levels
 of
 B
 are
 typically
 more
 tired
 Therefore
 we
 could
 use
 self
 reported
 energy
 as
 our
 metric
 gather
 data
 regarding
 various
 levels
 of
 B
 intake
 and
 establish
 the
 recommended
 intake
 of
 B
 The
 problem
 of
 course
 is
 there
 are
 several
 confounding
 factors
 Sleep
 stress
 vitamin
 C
 carnitine
 sodium
 and
 caloric
 intake
 levels
 are
 all
 known
 contributors
 for
 energy
 levels
 To
 avoid
 this
 sort
 of
 problem
 in
 keeping
 with
 Kaaks
 argument
 instead
 we
 could
 select
 more
 delineated
 and
 measurable
 biological
 outcomes
 In
 terms
 of
 B
 this
 would
 be
 something
 like
 an
 assessment
 of
 red
 blood
 cells
 or
 even
 better
 an
 actual
 measurement
 of
 serum
 B
 However
 this
 isnt
 possible
 within
 the
 framework
 of
 epidemiology
 considering
 it
 is
 done
 through
 selfreported
 nutritional
 studies
 and
 aggregating
 preexisting
 data
 This
 is
 why
 nutritional
 science
 is
 so
 messy
 and
 why
 epidemiological
 correlations
 cannot
 be
 taken
 at
 face
 value
 Its
 nearly
 impossible
 to
 isolate
 a
 singular
 explanatory
 variable
 nutrient
 and
 reasonably
 demonstrate
 it
 having
 causal
 power
 when
 we
 cant
 actually
 identify
 a
 response
 variable
 that
 isnt
 confounded
 by
 other
 nutrients
 Because
 of
 this
 the
 data
 is
 susceptible
 to
 bias
 Sackett
 in
 his
 study
 of
 bias
 catalogs
 nearly
 
 different
 types
 of
 biases
 that
 arise
 during
 sampling
 and
 measurement
 most
 of
 which
 are
 present
 in
 this
 type
 of
 epidemiological
 study
 Sackett
 When
 there
 is
 no
 consensus
 on
 what
 constitutes
 a
 good
 physiological
 endpoint
 you
 can
 always
 stack
 the
 cards
 in
 your
 deck
 to
 demonstrate
 your
 apriori
 hypothesis
 Implicit
 biases
 are
 bound
 to
 creep
 in
 muddying
 the
 data
 and
 not
 producing
 useful
 results
 The
 third
 primary
 criticism
 of
 the
 RDAs
 and
 their
 establishment
 was
 the
 massive
 amount
 of
 variability
 found
 in
 nutrient
 needs
 among
 individuals
 There
 are
 physiological
 difference
 that
 will
 be
 present
 among
 obvious
 biological
 divides
 age
 weight
 and
 gender
 being
 the
 immediate
 culprits
 However
 you
 will
 notice
 that
 all
 food
 labels
 the
 primary
 resource
 for
 individuals
 calculating
 their
 daily
 intake
 only
 report
 a
 one
 size
 fits
 all
 value
 for
 each
 micro
 and
 macronutrient
 Surely
 the
 recommended
 daily
 allowance
 is
 different
 for
 a
 yearold
 girl
 than
 for
 a
 yearold
 mans
 Though
 the
 RDAs
 were
 established
 in
 the
 s
 this
 conundrum
 wasnt
 even
 considered
 until
 as
 recently
 as
 a
 few
 decades
 ago
 During
 deliberations
 in
 the
 mids
 the
 FNB
 decided
 to
 replace
 this
 single
 set
 of
 values
 with
 multiple
 sets
 of
 values
 For
 designated
 age
 groups
 physiological
 states
 for
 example
 pregnancy
 and
 by
 sex
 These
 values
 are
 collectively
 referred
 to
 as
 the
 DRIs
 National
 Agricultural
 Library
 Putting
 aside
 the
 aforementioned
 implicit
 epidemiological
 problems
 with
 how
 the
 data
 was
 collected
 as
 well
 as
 the
 new
 DRIs
 not
 being
 easily
 accessible
 to
 the
 general
 public
 there
 are
 other
 issues
 associated
 with
 variability
 in
 nutrient
 needs
 For
 example
 when
 establishing
 the
 recommended
 daily
 allowances
 in
 order
 to
 account
 for
 variability
 Beaton
 noted
 that
 the
 Food
 and
 Nutrition
 Board
 decided
 to
 set
 the
 recommendation
 two
 standard
 deviations
 above
 the
 mean
 Beaton
 The
 rationale
 for
 doing
 this
 is
 that
 when
 observations
 are
 normally
 distributed
 two
 standard
 deviations
 above
 the
 mean
 accounts
 for
 roughly
 
 of
 the
 population
 By
 covering
 this
 high
 of
 a
 percentage
 of
 the
 population
 they
 reasoned
 the
 nutrient
 recommendation
 would
 be
 sufficient
 This
 is
 modeled
 in
 Figure
 
 the
 standard
 normal
 Gaussian
 distribution
 below
 There
 is
 a
 massive
 underlying
 problem
 with
 this
 methodology
 though
 The
 Recommended
 Dietary
 Allowances
 th
 Edition
 points
 out
 itself
 that
 there
 is
 little
 evidence
 that
 requirements
 for
 nutrients
 are
 normally
 distributed
 NRC
 The
 National
 research
 council
 backs
 this
 point
 illustrating
 The
 distribution
 of
 the
 iron
 requirements
 for
 women
 for
 example
 is
 skewed
 NCR
 All
 of
 the
 known
 dietary
 recommendations
 we
 have
 were
 currently
 formulated
 using
 a
 Gaussian
 assumption
 that
 we
 have
 little
 to
 no
 evidence
 for
 In
 keeping
 with
 these
 criticisms
 Butte
 designed
 an
 experiment
 in
 an
 attempt
 to
 evaluate
 the
 DRIs
 for
 breastfed
 infants
 and
 whether
 or
 not
 the
 claims
 of
 variability
 held
 up
 He
 found
 after
 
 months
 that
 A
 reevaluation
 of
 energy
 and
 protein
 intakes
 and
 allowances
 during
 infancy
 is
 merited
 Butte
 We
 can
 surmise
 from
 this
 treatment
 that
 not
 only
 is
 there
 massive
 variability
 between
 age
 groups
 gender
 and
 age
 but
 that
 even
 within
 constrained
 categories
 there
 is
 a
 level
 of
 flexible
 that
 is
 not
 accurately
 portrayed
 by
 a
 normal
 distribution
 Further
 research
 needs
 to
 be
 done
 in
 order
 to
 accurately
 prescribe
 Previously
 we
 considered
 nondietary
 related
 confounding
 factors
 present
 in
 epidemiological
 research
 Similarly
 there
 is
 another
 problem
 presented
 by
 how
 nutrients
 actually
 interact
 with
 each
 other
 Willet
 who
 has
 studied
 the
 difficulties
 in
 nutrition
 research
 extensively
 notes
 Studies
 in
 diet
 in
 relation
 to
 disease
 raise
 methodological
 challenges
 considerably
 more
 complicated
 than
 in
 most
 epidemiological
 investigations
 Diet
 is
 not
 a
 single
 exposure
 but
 rather
 a
 complex
 set
 of
 many
 intercorrelated
 continuous
 variables
 Willet
 He
 correctly
 identifies
 that
 nutrients
 are
 not
 independent
 random
 variables
 rather
 they
 work
 together
 cohesively
 and
 each
 must
 be
 evaluated
 in
 context
 of
 the
 other
 The
 clearest
 example
 of
 this
 phenomenon
 is
 Vitamin
 C
 and
 glucose
 Santosh
 et
 Al
 noted
 that
 Vitamin
 C
 is
 structurally
 similar
 to
 glucose
 and
 may
 therefore
 compete
 with
 glucose
 for
 transportation
 into
 the
 cell
 Santosh
 In
 other
 words
 the
 amount
 of
 Vitamin
 C
 an
 individual
 optimally
 requires
 is
 going
 to
 be
 contingent
 on
 the
 amount
 of
 dietary
 glucose
 they
 ingest
 We
 see
 this
 reflected
 in
 the
 literature
 with
 Dakhale
 noting
 that
 supplementation
 of
 Vitamin
 C
 reduces
 blood
 glucose
 Vitamin
 C
 is
 not
 the
 only
 example
 Harvard
 medical
 school
 points
 out
 nonexhaustively
 a
 list
 of
 other
 nutrients
 that
 compete
 for
 absorption
 vitamin
 D
 and
 calcium
 sodium
 and
 potassium
 B
 and
 folate
 zinc
 and
 copper
 niacin
 and
 tryptophan
 Harvard
 The
 implication
 of
 this
 is
 crucial
 and
 needs
 to
 be
 understood
 by
 anyone
 studying
 epidemiological
 data
 and
 trying
 to
 derive
 causations
 An
 individual
 for
 example
 eating
 a
 low
 carb
 diet
 is
 going
 to
 have
 completely
 different
 Vitamin
 C
 and
 nutrients
 in
 general
 requirements
 than
 an
 individual
 eating
 a
 high
 carb
 diet
 A
 critical
 distinction
 needs
 to
 be
 drawn
 between
 absorption
 and
 consumption
 in
 order
 for
 daily
 allowances
 to
 be
 properly
 recommended
 After
 considering
 the
 primary
 criticisms
 that
 have
 been
 leveled
 at
 the
 recommended
 daily
 allowances
 and
 their
 establishment
 we
 can
 conclude
 that
 some
 are
 well
 founded
 while
 others
 are
 not
 Labeling
 and
 communication
 of
 daily
 allowances
 is
 a
 minor
 problem
 Similarly
 its
 troubling
 to
 note
 that
 we
 dont
 have
 good
 evidence
 for
 the
 Gaussian
 distribution
 of
 nutrient
 needs
 however
 when
 considering
 how
 liberally
 the
 Nutrition
 board
 was
 with
 their
 recommendations
 this
 hardly
 seems
 like
 an
 immediate
 concerrn
 However
 other
 issues
 addressed
 in
 this
 work
 are
 severe
 and
 we
 dont
 presently
 have
 viable
 solutions
 The
 pitfalls
 of
 epidemiology
 
 nutritional
 surveys
 bias
 lack
 of
 explanatory
 power
 confounding
 factors
 
 make
 the
 validity
 of
 recommended
 daily
 allowances
 seem
 extremely
 unlikely
 If
 all
 of
 the
 methodological
 pitfalls
 are
 taken
 into
 account
 they
 may
 still
 have
 teleological
 utility
 but
 should
 not
 be
 held
 up
 as
 scientifically
 sound
 In
 the
 midst
 of
 an
 obesity
 epidemic
 a
 nutrient
 deficiency
 epidemic
 and
 a
 discorded
 eating
 epidemic
 we
 need
 better
 data
 The
 recommended
 daily
 allowances
 as
 established
 by
 the
 Food
 and
 Nutrition
 Board
 do
 not
 sufficiently
 establish
 or
 communicate
 accurate
 nutrient
 needs
 for
 the
 general
 public
 In
 order
 to
 help
 combat
 the
 current
 health
 crisis
 this
 literature
 review
 concludes
 that
 reevaluation
 of
 the
 methodological
 approach
 in
 establishing
 recommendations
 needs
 to
 take
 place
 The
 exponential
 distribution
 strongly
 resembles
 certain
 other
 distributions
 
 for
 example
 the
 poisson
 and
 geometric
 distributions
 
 but
 contains
 key
 differences
 that
 allow
 statisticians
 to
 solve
 problems
 that
 would
 otherwise
 be
 difficult
 Historically
 the
 exponential
 distribution
 was
 created
 to
 model
 scenarios
 involving
 time
 making
 it
 extremely
 useful
 and
 one
 of
 the
 most
 common
 distribution
 models
 Specifically
 it
 is
 representative
 of
 the
 waiting
 time
 until
 the
 first
 event
 in
 a
 random
 process
 occurs
 Examining
 the
 exponential
 distributions
 relationship
 with
 other
 distributions
 helps
 us
 understand
 its
 utility
 and
 properties
 further
 The
 poisson
 distribution
 for
 example
 is
 closely
 related
 with
 the
 exponential
 the
 key
 discrepancy
 being
 their
 units
 of
 measurement
 The
 exponential
 uses
 length
 of
 time
 until
 a
 certain
 occurrence
 as
 its
 unit
 of
 measurement
 whereas
 the
 poisson
 measures
 the
 number
 of
 occurrences
 within
 a
 given
 time
 interval
 Similarly
 a
 gamma
 distribution
 is
 simply
 the
 sum
 of
 mutually
 independent
 exponential
 random
 variables
 and
 the
 geometric
 distribution
 is
 the
 exponentials
 discrete
 complement
 Concrete
 examples
 of
 when
 an
 exponential
 distribution
 should
 be
 used
 could
 be
 instructive
 Common
 instances
 would
 be
 the
 length
 of
 time
 until
 a
 volcano
 erupts
 or
 the
 amount
 of
 time
 a
 customer
 spends
 within
 a
 store
 until
 they
 buy
 something
 One
 specific
 application
 that
 arises
 from
 the
 exponential
 distribution
 is
 the
 concept
 of
 reliability
 in
 other
 words
 a
 prediction
 of
 time
 before
 a
 product
 breaks
 down
 The
 lifetime
 of
 a
 lightbulb
 and
 how
 long
 before
 a
 certain
 piece
 of
 hardware
 goes
 faulty
 can
 both
 be
 modeled
 by
 the
 exponential
 distribution
 One
 last
 property
 that
 should
 be
 mentioned
 due
 to
 it
 being
 completely
 unique
 to
 the
 exponential
 distribution
 is
 the
 concept
 of
 memoryless
 This
 means
 that
 the
 probability
 that
 the
 event
 will
 happen
 within
 a
 time
 interval
 is
 independent
 of
 how
 much
 time
 has
 already
 elapsed
 without
 the
 event
 happening
 Taboga
 An
 intuitive
 example
 of
 this
 property
 would
 be
 the
 length
 of
 time
 until
 you
 get
 into
 a
 car
 crash
 Your
 probability
 of
 getting
 into
 an
 accident
 is
 not
 contingent
 on
 how
 long
 it
 has
 been
 since
 your
 last
 car
 crash
 You
 are
 no
 more
 likely
 now
 than
 you
 were
 a
 year
 ago
 than
 you
 will
 be
 in
 
 years
 The
 PDF
 of
 the
 exponential
 distribution
 is
 of
 the
 form
 Lambda
 
 e
 
 lambda
 
 x
 Lambda
 in
 this
 case
 is
 the
 rate
 of
 which
 it
 takes
 for
 a
 certain
 event
 to
 occur
 Given
 that
 the
 exponential
 distribution
 models
 time
 it
 can
 take
 on
 any
 positive
 value
 There
 are
 a
 few
 conditions
 that
 need
 to
 be
 satisfied
 in
 order
 for
 a
 probability
 density
 function
 to
 be
 considered
 valid
 though
 
 All
 values
 of
 fxx
 need
 to
 be
 positive
 
 The
 area
 of
 integration
 under
 the
 curve
 needs
 to
 equal
 to
 one
 Pictured
 below
 is
 a
 graph
 of
 the
 probability
 density
 curve
 for
 an
 exponential
 function
 with
 four
 different
 values
 for
 lambda
 
 
 
 and
 
 respectively
 Notice
 that
 for
 every
 x
 value
 there
 is
 an
 associated
 positive
 probability
 satisfying
 our
 first
 requirement
 Also
 regardless
 of
 lambda
 if
 you
 integrate
 underneath
 the
 curve
 you
 get
 a
 value
 equal
 to
 one
 The
 center
 and
 spread
 of
 the
 curve
 are
 both
 affected
 by
 the
 parameter
 lambda
 passed
 into
 the
 density
 function
 The
 shape
 however
 is
 unchanging
 regardless
 of
 the
 value
 of
 lambda
 the
 same
 basic
 exponential
 shape
 is
 maintained
 As
 lambda
 gets
 smaller
 the
 center
 of
 the
 distribution
 shifts
 to
 the
 right
 whereas
 the
 spread
 increases
 Intuitively
 when
 lambda
 increases
 the
 distribution
 shifts
 to
 the
 left
 and
 the
 spread
 decreases
 Unlike
 other
 distributions
 this
 is
 maintained
 regardless
 of
 whether
 or
 not
 lambda
 drops
 below
 
 Also
 given
 the
 exponential
 distribution
 can
 only
 take
 values
 of
 lambda
 greater
 than
 
 a
 negative
 value
 will
 never
 be
 passed
 in
 We
 know
 definitionally
 that
 we
 can
 derive
 the
 cumulative
 density
 function
 CDF
 by
 integrating
 our
 probability
 density
 function
 PDF
 from
 
 to
 infinity
 There
 are
 three
 requirements
 for
 a
 CDF
 to
 be
 valid
 
 The
 distribution
 must
 be
 nondecreasing
 
 As
 x
 approaches
 negative
 infinity
 the
 value
 of
 Fxx
 approaches
 zero
 
 As
 x
 approaches
 positive
 infinity
 the
 value
 of
 Fxx
 approaches
 
 The
 CDF
 of
 the
 exponential
 distribution
 is
 pictured
 below
 with
 lambda
 taking
 on
 
 values
 
 
 
 and
 
 respectively
 Based
 on
 the
 graph
 above
 we
 see
 that
 each
 of
 the
 
 requirements
 for
 a
 proper
 cumulative
 density
 function
 are
 fulfilled
 The
 function
 is
 nondecreasing
 and
 approaches
 
 and
 
 when
 approaching
 positive
 and
 negative
 infinity
 respectively
 Unsurprisingly
 the
 center
 and
 spread
 of
 the
 curve
 change
 when
 the
 lambda
 parameter
 is
 adjusted
 As
 lambda
 increases
 the
 center
 is
 shifted
 to
 the
 left
 on
 the
 spread
 decreases
 with
 the
 opposite
 being
 true
 as
 lambda
 decreases
 Similar
 to
 the
 PDF
 the
 shape
 remains
 unchanged
 The
 expected
 value
 EX
 of
 the
 exponential
 distribution
 can
 be
 derived
 by
 taking
 the
 integral
 of
 x
 multiplied
 by
 the
 probability
 density
 function
 with
 respect
 to
 x
 The
 actual
 derivation
 is
 pictured
 below
 resulting
 in
 an
 expected
 value
 of
 
 over
 lambda
 The
 variance
 Var
 of
 X
 can
 be
 found
 in
 a
 similar
 way
 to
 the
 expected
 value
 the
 shortcut
 formula
 being
 the
 EX
 minus
 the
 EX
 The
 EX
 can
 be
 found
 the
 same
 way
 as
 the
 EX
 in
 the
 previous
 derivation
 only
 substituting
 in
 X
 for
 X
 The
 full
 derivation
 of
 the
 VarX
 is
 pictured
 below
 We
 can
 also
 derive
 the
 moment
 generating
 function
 of
 an
 exponential
 distribution
 in
 order
 to
 obtain
 the
 expected
 value
 of
 x
 among
 other
 moments
 In
 order
 to
 do
 this
 we
 simply
 take
 the
 typical
 formula
 for
 a
 moment
 generating
 function
 substituting
 in
 the
 probability
 density
 function
 of
 the
 exponential
 distribution
 and
 then
 solving
 this
 integration
 Ultimately
 our
 moment
 generating
 function
 ends
 up
 being
 lambda
 divided
 by
 lambda
 minus
 t
 After
 we
 have
 obtained
 the
 moment
 generating
 function
 we
 can
 then
 use
 that
 function
 to
 derive
 the
 expected
 value
 of
 an
 exponential
 To
 do
 this
 we
 simply
 take
 the
 first
 derivative
 of
 the
 moment
 generating
 function
 The
 derivation
 is
 pictured
 below
 The
 maximum
 likelihood
 estimator
 for
 the
 exponential
 distribution
 can
 be
 derived
 with
 
 relatively
 easy
 steps
 each
 of
 which
 is
 demonstrated
 in
 the
 graphic
 below
 The
 first
 step
 is
 obtaining
 the
 likelihood
 function
 by
 obtaining
 the
 product
 of
 the
 pdf
 with
 x
 to
 xn
 values
 of
 x
 Then
 in
 order
 to
 make
 taking
 the
 derivative
 easier
 we
 take
 the
 log
 of
 the
 likelihood
 function
 After
 weve
 obtained
 the
 log
 likelihood
 we
 take
 the
 derivative
 with
 respect
 to
 lambda
 Finally
 we
 set
 that
 equation
 equal
 to
 zero
 and
 solve
 for
 lambda
 which
 in
 turn
 becomes
 our
 MLE
 For
 my
 example
 of
 an
 exponential
 distribution
 I
 observed
 how
 long
 it
 took
 for
 any
 individual
 to
 go
 to
 the
 water
 fountain
 inside
 my
 local
 gym
 The
 exponential
 is
 an
 appropriate
 distribution
 given
 that
 it
 models
 the
 amount
 of
 time
 required
 for
 a
 certain
 event
 to
 happen
 The
 observations
 are
 pictured
 below
 Intuitively
 these
 values
 appear
 to
 follow
 an
 exponential
 distribution
 Most
 of
 the
 values
 are
 relatively
 low
 hovering
 around
 
 to
 
 seconds
 However
 there
 are
 a
 few
 larger
 values
 that
 seem
 to
 grow
 exponentially
 
 seconds
 and
 
 seconds
 being
 good
 examples
 Graphically
 this
 hypothesis
 is
 beared
 out
 with
 the
 histogram
 of
 the
 data
 being
 pictured
 below
 overlaid
 with
 a
 line
 for
 the
 probability
 density
 function
 This
 demonstrates
 that
 our
 data
 does
 indeed
 follow
 an
 exponential
 distributionGiven
 that
 the
 distribution
 is
 used
 as
 a
 derived
 distribution
 for
 inference
 we
 can
 create
 a
 simulation
 of
 exponential
 values
 obtain
 statistics
 and
 graph
 the
 data
 appropriately
 In
 R
 I
 simulated
 data
 from
 an
 exponential
 distribution
 using
 the
 rexp
 function
 
 with
 
 observations
 and
 a
 rate
 of
 
 Unsurprisingly
 this
 seems
 to
 strongly
 mirror
 the
 data
 collected
 at
 the
 drinking
 fountain
 The
 mean
 of
 the
 simulated
 data
 was
 
 whereas
 the
 mean
 of
 the
 real
 data
 was
 
 This
 makes
 sense
 when
 you
 consider
 the
 mean
 of
 an
 exponential
 distribution
 is
 one
 divided
 by
 lambda
 in
 this
 case
 one
 divided
 by
 
 which
 is
 equal
 to
 
 Pictured
 below

 graph
 of
 the
 simulated
 data
 along
 with
 the
 underlying
 probability
 density
 function
