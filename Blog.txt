One of the things I’ve always wondered about Superheroes is whether they had to workout for their muscles, or if they just kind of naturally came with the gig. I always assumed the latter, but then Fat-Thor in Avengers-Endgame threw me for a loop. Like were he and Clark Kent counting their macros and bench pressing trains while no one was watching?
If you think about it, Toby Maguire’s Spider-Man became instantaneously jacked when he was bit – but Spiderverse Peter ended up with a belly. Billy Batson is naturally ripped in his Shazam form, but Mr. Incredible had to workout and eat properly in order to take several inches off of his waist. 
Is Muscle-Thor significantly stronger than Fat-Thor? It doesn’t seem like it. If they’re the same strength, then was Thor’s body purely for aesthetics? Also, if Muscle-Thor is stronger – how much of a difference does lifting actually make, considering he is already a God? 
Along the same vein, has the Flash capped out in speed, or could he become even faster through training? Could we ever see a Fat-Hulk, or a severely skinny Thanos?
If Asgardian Gods can become fat, what other biochemistry do they share with humans? Could they develop cancerous cells, contract a sexually transmitted disease or have a gluten intolerance?
The way I see it we are left with two options. Either (1) Superheroes are predestined to have a certain strength and body composition or (2) Superheroes have to workout, eat properly and get adequate amounts of sleep in order to maintain their physique. Both of these options just feel intuitively wrong.
The idea that people lose weight because they eat less calories than they expend is technically right but functionally wrong – a sort of Luciferian half-truth half-lie.
Yes – in order to accumulate subcutaneous fat there has to be a caloric surplus. However, as far as I can tell, that statement doesn’t actually communicate any meaningful information. It only begs the question; WHY did the calorie surplus occur in the first place?
The prevailing narrative is that people are hedonistic and lazy. They don’t know when to put the fork down and won’t get off their fat asses to exercise.
This is not only wrong, but dangerous. People have been given dietary advice that makes fat loss impossible and then shamed into thinking that they lack the willpower to succeed.
The “calories in calories out” hypothesis treats all calorically equal foods as qualitatively equal. “100 calories is 100 calories” whether it comes from chicken, beef, cake, pasta, celery or canola oil. 
What you eat affects how much you eat.
Women get cravings on their periods, men slim out and build muscle when taking testosterone, people lose their appetite when depressed and we’ve all eaten when we’re stressed. 
Hormones and other physiological indicators (hunger, satiety, insulin, blood sugar, sleep, energy, cravings, etc…)  are crucial variables when considering eating behavior and its subsequent effect on weight regulation. Of course, the nutrition profile (qualitative) of the food we eat is directly correlated with these barometers. 
What you eat affects how much you eat.
You would never call someone a hedonist if they felt the need to drink more water than their body actually needed. If somebody was chronically tired despite consistently getting sufficient sleep, wouldn’t you look to *other* confounding factors that might be affecting their energy, instead of telling them to sleep less?
Instead of asking “why can’t people stop eating” I think the better question is “why is everyone always hungry.”
Footnote: I have no idea what the best diet is – and this post isn’t trying to posit an answer. All I’m suggesting is the current system of thought surrounding the obesity epidemic is maladaptive.
In an attempt to repeat myself loudly and often, let me say it again: secondary colors are for villains and betas only.
All the main heroes wear primary colors: Superman, Wonder Woman, Spiderman, Ironman, Captain America, Mario…
Inversely, all major villains (and b-list heroes) wear secondary colors: Luigi, Joker, Green Goblin, Hulk, Thanos, Loki, Aquaman, Lex Luthor…
This artistic choice, obviously, is intentional; the writers are trying to communicate something important about the characters through their clothing. 
Eww, orange? Who the hell wears orange? Velma, Mermaid Man, Vector (committing crimes with both direction and magnitude), Dora… 
And don’t even get me started on green (Looking at you Mike Wazowski, Shrek, Grinch, Plankton)
Billie with her green hair gets a pass, she’s America’s darling right now. The rest of you need to get your shit together – there’s a reason Halloween colors are purple, green and orange.
No Country for Old Men is a masterpiece – engaging you from the start, and subverting your expectations in all the right ways. It draws on the oldest archetypal theme of the human experience (order and chaos) but introduces a level of moral ambiguity that leaves you walking away thinking, “What the hell just happened?”
On the surface the movie starts out trying to convince you it’s a classic western. Good guy chasing treasure – bad guy trying to stop him. We’ve seen it a hundred times…
Cormac MCCarthy is too smart for that though. The “hero” is killed off screen, the bad guy gets away, the money is lost, and the deuteragonist ends up depressed. All of this underlined by the fact that the film doesn’t have a single music score.
It was never about Llewelyn and it was never about Chigurh. The movie is called “No Country for Old Men”, and that’s exactly what it’s about; an old man that doesn’t belong. This movie is about Bell – and what he represents.
Bell is a police officer – an upholder of the law both allegorically and literally. He wants morality and justice to be straight forward; clear cut delineations between right and wrong. As the audience, we watch this idealistic worldview progressively shatter until he ultimately becomes disillusioned.
Standing as a foil, Anton represents the seemingly arbitrary nature of reward and punishment – validating God’s claim to “maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.” (Matthew 5:45)
He embodies chaos – cold and dispassionate, drawing no meaningful distinction between humans and bovines (hence the cattle bolt stunner he uses to kill). His motivations are completely unclear – and he shows little to no emotion throughout the film; even after  getting hit by a car, or self-performing surgery.
Whether the God’s will smile on you or not is as arbitrary as a coin flip. I mean, “If the rule you followed brought you to this – then of what use was the rule?” It’s a moral relativism steel-man at its finest.
Bell can’t hold that space. The movie ends with him recounting a dream – where his father rode into the night, carrying a torch to light the way. He wants traditional, old, fatherly values to dictate the way we orient ourselves.
That’s not the world we live in though. Ambiguity and uncertainty exist everywhere. This isn’t a country for Old Men – you can`t be naive and toxically optimistic. However, cynicism and nihilism aren’t a solution either. McCarthy doesn’t try to resolve the conflict. Rather, like all great artists, he allows the audience to figure it out for themselves.
Falling in love isn’t hard, we’re biologically inclined, to find someone and get attached, it’s easy if you try. People act like love is special but you can hotwire the connection, try these simple hacks with anyone, things will move in the right direction. Make inside jokes then gossip, swap saliva trauma bond, the neurochemical reaction will make your feelings correspond. Oxytocin when you cuddle, you get dopamine from kissing, serotonin from social status, cortisol when they are missing. You start to date and things are great till 9 months in the feelings fade - it’s a sign they’re not the one for you, their love was a charade. You ball your fists in anger and curse your God above, it feels like an injustice to keep falling out of love. Falling in love is an addiction and just like any other stimuli, you discard when it’s convenient and chase a newer, better high. We need to reconceptualize, the definitions really matter - love is not the disney phase, it’s the commitment that comes after.
If you lie to somebody and they believe it, not only does it eat away at your own soul – but *you* grow to resent *them*.
I don’t fully understand why.
Maybe you begin to feel like they don’t know you well enough to recognize you’re lying. Or, worse, that they don’t care to know you well enough. 
Maybe you feel they’re too stupid to catch on? Or maybe you feel bad about lying so you’re externalizing the problem, or projecting or something like that. I don’t know.
But as unfair as it is – you almost lose respect for someone who would łet you get away with it. So even if you don’t get caught, lying still damages the relationship.
So don’t lie
“Straw” berry days is a fitting title, because this festival absolutely *sucks*. The rides? 0 stars. The food? 0 stars. The strawberries? Couldn’t tell you –  because despite its name, I have yet to see a single one of the sweet, soft, sensual fruits with the seed-studded surface. 
Have I ever gone to Strawberry Days and not been disappointed? Once. Has Tre ever gone to Strawberry Days and not been disappointed? Nonce. Am I going to keep asking myself rhetorical questions? Well, that’s what I end up doing every time I’m there, so I feel like it’s only fitting. 
I mean, which of us hasn’t thought, “Did I actually spend money on this?” or “Why can I see half the buttcheek of every 15 year old girl here?” I’ve had more fun getting cavities filled, there’s at least laughing gas. Next time let’s shoot for more strawberries at the strawberry festival. 1 star.
If I ask you how many people you hate and you say “zero” then I don’t trust you. Everybody should hate at least somebody.
“Hate is a strong word.” Yeah, it’s a strong word for a strong emotion, quit moralizing it. Feelings aren’t “good” or “bad” – I mean some of them are unpleasant – but they’re just emotions. They’re useful. Besides, if you don’t have the capacity to hate then love doesn’t really mean anything anyways.
We’re not very good at following the ecclesiastical wisdom “there is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens.” There’s justice and mercy, chaos and order. Compassion is a good thing – but taken too far and it becomes a vice. Sometimes you should turn the other cheek, other times you need to grab your whip and cleanse a temple. 
There’s a time to love and a time to hate.
There’s something vivifying – almost life giving about hatred. I *like* having an antagonist in life – somebody to root against. It’s life’s second greatest motivator (behind heartbreak). 
Also, cmon. Everybody knew at least one bitch from high school that still makes your blood boil.
Sunday. The four letter word of six letter words. As a schoolboy it marked the end of a hedonistic 48 hours – exchanging late-nights and video games for mechanical pencils and tardy slips.
As an adult, however, the feelings of dread take on a new form – as Saturday softly slips, and Sunday sentiments slowly surface.
Sunday. When the feral beast wakes from his hebdomadal slumber. And by what name does the savage answer? Boredom…
See an idle brain is the devil’s workshop, and the prince of darkness might as well call his enterprise “Al-Lif-Kcihc” because (especially for the perennially preoccupied) sometimes it is *only* open on Sundays.
Born into relatively moderate circumstances, at the age of 21 during his trip to the petting zoo in Scipio, our hero mistakes a group of poison dart frogs as being a part of the exhibit. Picking them up in his arms, he’s fatally wounded, but survives the experience and, as a consequence, gains the lung capacity of 6 times a regular human.
Driven to the depths of depression by the mundanity of life among normal humans, and the burden of his secret, he flees to Nepal to escape his self-loathing, where he runs into a female member of the League of Shadows at Bed, Bath and Beyond.
Of course, he is stricken by her innate physical beauty – but, more importantly, he overhears he referring to a partially used candle as being in its’ “Waxing Gibbous Phase” (a delightful pun) and falls for her immediately.
He makes noticeable eye-contact with her several times but lacks the self-confidence to make a corporeal approach. Finally, to his delight, she approaches him. They chit-chat for a while and eventually she says, “You know, I’m not supposed to do this, but would you like to come back to my place?”
He agrees. Partly because of her natural beauty and down to earth nature – but mostly out of pure intrigue. Why isn’t she supposed to have guys over? Why won’t she tell him her name? He makes a mental note to assign her the alias of “Gibbous” and they make their way back to her apartment.
After a few hours of monopoly he ends up staying the night. There was no physical intimacy involved because they both had clear-cut standards and would never kiss somebody on the first date.
Waking up in the middle of the night to get a glass of water, as he stumbles across the room in the dark, he accidentally pulls down a secret lever masquerading as a succulent, revealing a hidden room. Upon entering, he immediately notices a giant rug with the head of the demon insignia and several swords mounted on the wall.
He turns to leave the room and finds Gibbous standing at the entrance of the doorway. Crying, she explains everything. She is a member of the League of Shadows – and is forbidden from seeing other men. She fears that the league will find out that he knows her secret, track him down, and kill both of them. So, in an attempt to hide in plain sight, she offers him a job as an intern for the League.
He starts at the bottom of the totem pole – mostly getting towels for other members and running small errands down to the village. With time, and through careful observation, he learns a thing or 2 about combat and becomes a master illusionist (mostly just card tricks to entertain the other members to get them to like him, though).
Eventually, unable to bear the burden of not being together, he and Gibbous sneak off and get married in a Taiwanese temple. They return without anybody noticing their absence, go to extreme measures to safeguard their secret – until one night, thinking themselves to be alone, they get caught making out underneath a night-flowering-jasmine tree by a star-gazing league member trying out his new telescope.
They flee, narrowly escaping with their lives. Knowing that it’s the one place the League would never look, they make there way to Vineyard Utah.
With a revamped passion and purpose in life – he decides to devote his existence to goodness, assuming the alias of “The Dart”. He wears an all-black outfit, with a golden mask. His weapon of choice is a blowdart, which he can fire with pinpoint accuracy up to 1400 yards away. When the situation warrants close-quarter combat – the blowdart separates into 2 batons, and his breath is used to deflect enemy punches. His “perch” (if you will) is on top of the Maverick Gas Station, where he navigates his surroundings and keeps the people of Vineyard safe
His greatest nemesis is “The Extinguisher”. Here’s where things get interesting, though. The Dart *is* The Extinguisher. Traumatized by his time in Nepal – he has developed a split personality disorder that sporadically manifests itself as an unhealthy coping mechanism. He is unaware of the episodes – and incognizant of his own malevolent nature.
Like the sportsman who finds gratification in the ache of muscle, or the penitent sinner welcoming remorse of conscience in favor of apathy: The Grassy Protuberance offers an ethereal retreat to those rarified individuals that find the perennial discomfort of solitude so, so comforting.
Solitude, not in a Material sense of the word, but in a holistic one: Mind, Body and Soul. Where the Ego slowly fades into nothingness, and the threat of status disappears with the metaphorical lights, and the cameras and the music…
And the individual – the real individual – finds himself alone. With all his inherent shame, bodily insecurities and repressed fears seeping into the conscious mind palace – as the draw bridges of Routine are lowered, and the Walls of Pride are scaled!
The prospect is daunting, yes, but it is only when sober that one understands drunkenness, and only those who are awake understand the nature of sleep. So, set your alarms – and discover the satiety of grassy seclusion.
The inspiration for the title came from a blog post of roughly the same name. In it the author observes that although all of our contemporary actors and actresses are *aesthetically* beautiful – they are strangely lacking in any real allure or sexual energy.
This rang true immediately. Think about Marvel – a good representative of popular culture. In the obligatory shirtless reveal for every movie, their bodies are literally perfect – so why don’t any of them *feel* sexy?
Ironically, the character that exudes the most sexual energy (RDJ’s IronMan) is the least conventionally attractive of all the major heroes.
This blog isn’t about Marvel, and it’s not about being horny or having sex (although it’s relevant and interesting that in the most “openly sexual” climate in human history nobody is actually having sex).
No, instead I want to abstract out that core concept because I think it’s important.
Take Instagram, for example, and think about how meta it’s gotten. The app used to be openly performative: staged backgrounds, obvious posing and intentional outfits (which I’m fine with, btw).
Now, however, it’s taken things a step further – with casual instagram being “performatively-nonperformative” in the same way reality TV mimics real life. We’re signaling “down to earth” by staging meticulous “casual candid photo dumps”, and it feels even more soulless than its predecessor.
Our Priests don’t feel priestly, our news outlets are liars, our tiktokers are sexless and Taylor Swift – our symbol of female empowerment – is a lifeless marionette with 100 people pulling the strings behind the scenes. (Sorry to drag Taylor into this, Swifties). 
Even politics – the place where people *seem* the most passionate – just feels like gutless posturing and feigned moral outrage. I don’t see people, I see mouthpieces masquerading as people. “People don’t have ideas, ideas have people”. 
And finally there’s sex. What healthy models of sex do we have to turn to? Everything is either pornographic or Hollywoodized. I can’t think of a single realistic sex scene is cinema….
The point I’m trying to make is I feel like we’ve lost what makes us human. We’re really good at *mimicking* emotion – or sexuality, or piousness, or creative thought – and really bad at *actually* expressing it. We’re physically alive but spiritually dead (there’s a reason the zombie myth has taken such a grip on our culture).
I’m projecting. I’m just as much of a vapid, inauthentic virtue-signaler as the next guy, but I don’t want to be. I don’t łike feeling łike a xerox of a xerox.
This blog is going to be messy:) Even if it sucks (it’s probably going to suck) I hope it at least has a soul – and isn’t just a blog trying to be a blog.
“To live is the rarest thing in the world; most people just exist.” – Oscar Wilde
If you haven’t seen the Lego Batman Movie (Stockton) here’s my most concise, convincing argument for why you should.


Of all the contemporary films, TLBM is the only one that gets the essence of the Batman mythos right. Hero stories aren’t about superpowers. Rather, their slate of abilities stand as a foil for a super-weakness.


At the heart of the Batman story (behind the crime-fighting, and the gadgeting, and the detectiving) is a deeply broken individual, struggling to cope with loss.


Batman is about loneliness.


Genius level IQ, never ending money, mastery of physical combat, gorgeous looks - all of these (superficially nice) character traits only serve to further distinguish him from the common man.


Batman was created to be more than “flesh and blood”. He’s a symbol; an idea. In many ways, Bruce is more alien than Superman.


Unable to let anyone in - he dresses in all black, only comes out at night, and deals with his anger by beating Gotham’s criminal underworld to a pulp.


LBM gets this; and it feels sooooo right.


Also, the first 25-30 minutes are about as hard as I’ve ever laughed. The jokes are so quick; so clever. I’ve never seen a movie rapid fire quip after quip łike this one does (3rd act notwithstanding). So if you haven’t seen it already (Stockton) please make it a priority.
A few entertainment tropes that I severely dislike.


(1) When falling debris from a collapsing building pins, but doesn’t fatally wound, a character. Please. They’re deader than a diabetic crashing on Willy Wonka’s couch for the week.


(2) To show us a character is cool and enviable, they cut to him/her surrounded by adoring peers - drinks in hands - telling the punchline of a joke we have no context for. It’s cheap, it’s been done too many times, and feels łike lazy writing; compensating for the fact you can’t actually write a funny joke that stands on its own.


(3) I feel łike I’m beating a dead horse at this point, but laser tripwire security systems that are extremely difficult (but not impossible) to navigate if you are extremely agile. Just make the thing *actually* impossible. This should be a no-brainer, but somehow jewel thief’s with grapnel guns, and women in sexy black leather, are bypassing these things left and right.


Is Veganism morally correct?


𝐀𝐫𝐠𝐮𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭
(1) Eating animal foods is requisite for optimal human health.
(2) Optimizing human health is desirable, as long as it is ethical.
(3) Eating animal food is desirable, as long as it is ethical.
(4) Something is ethical if it promotes an increase in net utility.
(5) Veganism does not increase net utility.
(6) Things that do not increase net utility are not ethical.
(7) Veganism is not ethical; eating animal foods is morally correct and desirable.


𝐃𝐞𝐟𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐞
There are specific micronutrients that can only be found in animal based products that are required for optimal human health (physical, mental and emotional). These include - but are not limited to - B12, creatine, zinc, heme-iron, carnitine, carnosine, D3, DHA, and taurine. The quantity and bioavailability of amino acids are also superior in animal products. Supplementation does not have the same effect, therefore premise (1).


Few would subscribe to slavery even if it was proven to be the best economic system - likewise, eating animal products should be done only if it is ethical (2)(3). Mill said, “Actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse… By happiness is intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain, and the privation of pleasure” (4).


By depriving people of requisite nutrients, and killing even more animals as a byproduct of crop harvesting, Veganism decreases net utility by reducing net pleasure, and increasing net pain (5) (6) (7).


𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
The most likely objection would be premise (5). Veganism argues that it reduces suffering. This is wrong for 3 reasons.


1) A bovine living a normal life, with a moment of slight confusion and possible terror at the end - is not morally comparable to self-conscious humans, with a theory of mind, suffering a lifetime of malnutrition, anemia, depression, sarcopenia, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, or Alzheimer's. Meat eating is anti human suffering.


2) Even if net suffering is disregarded and death count is the only thing taken into consideration, Veganism kills more animals through ancillary methods than meat-eating does. Tens of billions of bees are killed yearly to farm almonds in the U.S. Millions of possums, raccoons, mice, snakes, rodents and rabbits are killed through the process of conventional grain harvesting. Insects, worms, pests and bugs all have to be mitigated in order for crops to grow. A carnivore might (generously) go through 2 cows and 15 chickens in a year. A Vegan? Somewhere north of 100,000 animals. 


3) Veganism is accidentally anti-life. The easiest way to reduce suffering is to stop existing. Take its premises out to their logical conclusion, and you get the “Voluntary Human Extinction” Vegan organization, who believes that humans produce so much suffering to the planet, that we should expurgate ourselves. This is morally wrong, and Veganism often skirts these types of arguments.


Addendum: I used the premises that I did because most Vegan moralists make a utilitarian argument; asserting that Veganism decreases net suffering. However, if you’re not an “ends justify the means” type of person, a Kantian argument could be made as well. If faced with the option of starving to death, or killing and eating a cow, most would not find the latter morally objectionable.


𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞
Veganism is an increasingly growing movement, and is particularly appealing to young people. By adopting its principles under the false idea that it is morally superior, many individuals are suffering through severe health conditions, and accidentally killing more animals in the process.


Myers Briggs terminology needs to be stamped out of existence. The 4 letter shorthand has utility when trying to communicate a general personality type - but the confusion and misdirection that comes from the horrendously labeled dichotomies is a nightmare. 


To say nothing of the fact that there is no substantial evidence to support the idea of different cognitive functions - let’s focus exclusively on the vocabulary, and why it is so problematic. 


Thinking/Feeling. Good hell that label is frustrating. When you hear those two words, you intuitively conceptualize “intelligence fighting emotions”, for precedence over the human psyche. This is wrong. For a few reasons.


(1)) You’re conflating thinking with the Myers Briggs intuition (N) trait (openness in Big 5 model). Fluency with ideas, IQ, creativity and intelligence are all accounted for in a different trait. The “Thinking” trait has nothing to do with intelligence. I.e your capacity to think has nothing to do with the thinking trait. Under the Myers Briggs model, you could have an idiot “thinker” and a brilliant “feeler”. 


(2)) Most of the emotion that we experience is wound up in 2 distinct traits; extraversion and neuroticism. The positive spectrum of emotion being associated with the former - negative with the latter. Considering positive and negative emotion covers most of the emotional spectrum, it’s strange to conceptualize a trait as “feeling” when it has nothing to do with either of those. 


Confused? Yeah. Here’s the problem. “Thinking/Feeling” in the Myers Briggs terminology is supposed to be describing the much better named “Agreeable/Disagreeable” trait according to Big 5 terminology. Agreeable people are polite, non-confrontational and empathetic. They tend to put others’, or the group’s, needs before their own. Disagreeable people are blunt, assertive and competitive. They are more likely to advocate for themselves in a negotiation. Why they would choose to conceptualize disagreeable as “thinking” and agreeable as “feeling” is beyond me. 


(3) Notice how it’s called the “Big 5”, but Myers Briggs only has 4 traits? Despite Myers Briggs deriving it’s theory from the Big 5, they chose to minimize one of the primary traits; “Neuroticism”. This dichotomy describes an individual's propensity to experience “negative” emotion: anxiousness, depression and anger - with a low stress tolerance. It’s compliment could be conceptualized as emotional stability: high stress tolerance, and less likely to experience “negative” emotion. 


Ignoring this trait is a mistake. It massively informs our understanding of the individual in question. Neuroticism underpins all of the other traits. Highly neurotic individuals have the tendency to withdraw. Without an understanding of neuroticism, you could conflate this with introversion. Similarly, because anxious people view novel situations more threateningly, their “shove-off” defense mechanisms could be conflated with disagreeableness, and their depressed lack of motivation could be undeservedly mixed up with low conscientiousness. 


9 Boxes 50 Eagles 10 Alligators 3 Bears 7 Bulls 1 Human with a Shotgun 15 Wolves 10,000 Rats 5 Gorillas 4 Lions


Choose 2 to defend you - the rest are coming to kill you. What do you do?


Look. With questions like this there are always definitional / semantical problems that inform your decision. What’s the terrain? Can you command the animals defending you? Do you yourself have any weapons? Etc etc etc. Here’s the thing, though. Whichever (whatever?) way you slice it, there’s only 1 correct answer here. Rats and eagles. 


10,000. Do you realize how many 10,000 is? Picture your entire high school out on the football field for fire-drill simulations, then multiply that number by 4. Putting their protective capabilities aside, you have to pick the rats solely based on the fact that you could never survive that swarm. 


Now, their teeth are pretty strong. All it would take is a couple strong bites to the achilles, and that would mostly mitigate the slower moving land mammals. Where they would run into trouble would be the gators (because of their tough exterior) and the lions/wolves (because of how fast they are). Their best shot on the gators would either be to go for the eyes, or sacrifice yourself and try to suffocate/choke them. 


Picking the eagles, similar to the rats,  is mostly a matter of not having them on the other side. Rats wouldn’t be able to guard against an aerial attack - and a few eagles could take down a human pretty easily. They would be useful in safeguarding against the lions and wolves. They wouldn’t need to kill them - just go for the eyes, rendering them useless. 


You’re in for a tough time no matter who you pick, but no group could defend you from 10,000 bloodthirsty rodents  - and aerial attacks would be a nightmare -  so rats and eagles is the best way to hedge your bets.

Transport to Africa You know that super annoying thing that people say when you don’t finish your food, like “You’ve got to finish that, there are starving children in Africa who would eat that.” Well a superhero whose power is, after he’s gotten the requisite nutrition from his meal, any additional food goes through a transporter at the bottom of his esophagus and is sent to starving children in Africa. He still receives the pleasure of chewing and swallowing, but because the food isn’t actually metabolised, there are no physiological consequences. Some might think, “Sweet, eat whatever you want and don’t get fat!” but not him. No, he recognizes the challenging, and morally ambiguous situation that he’s been put in. Given the nature of his powers, he has a perennial feeling of shame anytime he isn’t eating. How could he be so selfish, to hang out with friends, play video games, or even sleep - when he could be saving the lives of starving children. Even if he’s feeling an enormous burden of responsibility, at least he can eat whatever he wants right? Maybe. The problem is (obviously) everything he eats is getting sent to little kids. While he could certainly blackout in a cake, ice cream and cookies sugar coma - the fact that that’s the nutrition starving children will be receiving is always in the back of his mind. Is it morally reprehensible to damage others, in his hedonistic pursuit of pleasure? Like any stimulus, the signal becomes weaker as it is chronically overused. Higher doses, in higher frequencies, are required to receive the same high. Food dictates his life - so by that token, the dopaminergic system is downregulated, and it begins to lose it’s pleasure. Eating becomes a chore - done out of pure virtuous duty.  Does he ever find the line balancing taking care of his own needs, and those he feels are under his stewardship? No. See, most people can’t be a positive force in the world, unless they take care of themselves first. Healed people heal people - hurt people hurt people. This guy isn’t “normal people” though. He can have a positive impact on the world (at least, the starving children in Africa sector of the world) and be absolutely miserable. A supervillain whose power is every time he falls asleep, he wakes up in a new person’s body. The host is incognizant during the time period - and as soon as the parasite falls asleep, the host regains consciousness. He’s basically immortal, because every time he falls asleep his “essence” just switches hosts.

This paper illustrates many of the problems encountered when uncovering the data used to set recommended daily allowances. Given these obstacles, the author argues that the RDA’s are “neither sacrosanct nor immutable but represent an informed judgement of current experiential data and everyday experience.” One of the primary premises that he offers in defense of this argument is the high degree of variation among individuals. Ignoring the massive variability between groups (sex, age, ethnicity) there is still substantial variability among individuals. This will be useful in defending and illustrating Russel’s third point, namely that there is an erroneous assumption in the homoscedasticity among individuals (particularly children). Downing attempts to evaluate the RDA’s using two primary questions; first, are they valid? Secondly, are they being achieved? The author does not, at least in this article, go into depth on the first question. Rather they aim to answer the second question: are individuals meeting the requirements outlined by the recommended daily allowances? Downing postulates that the answer is a resounding no. He then goes on to list several studies exemplifying this fact, and then gives a few reasons why he suspects this to be  case. Considering already have a plethora of articles to answer the first question (are they valid) this article is useful in demonstrating the habits of consumers This article focuses primarily on the correlation between cardiovascular risk factors and nutrition behaviors between both children and adults. Specifically, it looks at the percentage of certain macro and micro nutrients in relation to percentage of total caloric intake, along with the accompanying biological and physiological markers. The article then goes on to make recommendations for adequate intakes and proportions of certain micro and macronutrients. Although I won’t focus explicitly on cardiovascular disease, this article will be useful in the treatment of “endpoints” that should be focused on when regarding recommended daily allowances. Likewise, this is emblematic of the type of recommendations that are being given to individuals, as well as their underlying theory. Hegsted offers thorough critiques of the second objection that Russell posed in his article “Setting dietary intake levels: problems and pitfalls,” namely that the recommended daily allowances do not adequately define what the useful endpoints are when evaluating sufficient intake of certain nutrients. Specifically, he questions the RDA’s primarily semantic definitions of words like “goals, groups, good” and “people”. This article will be useful in establishing the flaws in theory underlying the recommendations, as well as further strengthening the critique made by Russell. This article speaks extensively about the origin of the dietary recommendations, particularly the context surrounding why the movement was catalyzed in the first place. It details the process for defining the recommended daily allowances, speaks to the definitions involved, makes note of the requisite criteria and finishes by commenting on how pharmacological substances could affect these recommendations. Although pharmacology and criteria will not be treated in my work, the process for defining the RDA’s as well as the definitions involved will be tremendously useful in evaluating the “endpoint” problem outlined by Russell The purpose of this article is to try and assess the optimal diet, and recommending it to individuals, that maximizes a low probability of deficiencies while avoiding going over the UL (upper intake level) for certain nutrients. The article goes into a considerable amount of depth attempting to identify the correct diet, showing several graphs and flowcharts. In particular it goes into depth about the methodology to develop recommended dietary allowances, adequate intake and upper intake levels. Then it takes about energy intakes in terms of helping individuals maintain or lose body fat, which is another relevant endpoint that should be taken into consideration when determining recommended daily allowances and the effect that they have on individuals. This article focuses primarily on the micronutrient inadequacies in the United States population. It identifies endpoints and then cross references data from national data surveys across the U.S in order to determine how well individuals are eating, and what can be done to combat nutrient deficiencies. The article is thorough, providing several charts to illustrate mean daily intakes from “natural” food, mean daily intakes including enrichments and EAR’s when accounting for all sources of nutrients. This will be useful in identifying how well, given the recommended daily allowances, individuals in the U.S have been able (or are motivated to) follow them This article is primarily arguing that the recommended daily allowances are preferable to the EAR’s (estimated average requirements) and should be used on nutrition labels. Though this comparison is not particularly useful to the subject of work at hand, it does dive extensively into the behavior of how consumers interact with nutrition labels. Understanding individual interpretations, and the teleological role that RDA’s are actually playing in the real world will be useful in determining whether or not they need to be adjusted “Recommended Dietary Allowances: 10th Edition” will arguably be the most important reference in this literature review. Considering this is the primary determinant in the implementation of the recommended daily allowances, significant insight can be gained by its careful study. The underlying theory of the RDA’s, how they first originated, the methodology by which they were established, how they have evolved over the years and where they stand today are all treated in this book. This article identifies the primary issues that individuals take with the Recommended Daily Allowances that have been established as a whole. The authors identify 5 objections that they find problemation: 1) They claim the assumption that there is a threshold level to each for each nutrient is invalid 2) The RDA’s lack a uniform criteria for how to evaluate the byproducts of sufficient nutrients as good 3) They erroneously extrapolate the nutrient needs of different groups such as children, women and the elderly 4) We seriously lack information on the response and interaction confounding factors of certain nutrients in the context of other nutrients 5) Individuals in the general community do not sufficiently understand how to use the recommendations. This literature review seeks to answer the questions raised by experts in the nutrition, dietetics and epidemiological fields surrounding the “Recommended Daily Allowances.” Specifically, it is interested in whether or not the RDA’s serve as both valid and reliable barometers for appropriate nutrient intake. There is currently no consensus among those studying the subject most thoroughly, so this review draws from multiple competing sources and attempts to synthesize the primary points, as well as formulate a solution. A working version of the recommended daily allowances have been in place since the 1940’s and are the standard metric for individuals trying to gauge their nutrient sufficiency. The primary objections to their utility are usually the methodology by which they were derived: specifically epidemiological studies and nutrition surveys. Given these tactics, the ultimate idea in question - and the one that this literature review strives to answer - is whether or not value can be derived from data rife with methodological red flags. Though other objections have been raised, this review will focus most heavily on epidemiology: how it works, its upsides, and its potential pitfalls. After addressing methodology and epidemiology, this article then seeks to answer questions surrounding the variability in nutrient intake among groups, and then the Everybody is interested in food. Given most individuals typically eat 2-4 times per day, a considerable amount of time and energy is spent into planning, preparing and eating our meals. Although food can be eaten for pleasure, utilized for social functions or to fulfill creative needs, it has always maintained two primary purposes: 1) a source of energy 2) a source of nutrients. Properly regulating our intake of foods that fulfill these two fundamental points (and those foods that do not) is in the best interest of any individual trying to maximize their own well-being. To this end, the first edition of Recommended Daily Allowances (RDA’s) was published in 1943, in an attempt to quantify the ideal amount of each macro and micronutrient that we should be consuming every day. Although nutrition science has advanced considerably since the 40’s, the same basic framework is still used in the United States today.         Unsurprisingly, considering how difficult dietetic research is, there is a considerable controversy surrounding the RDA’s and their effectiveness. The goal of this article is to review the relevant literature surrounding the underlying methodology and implementation of the RDA’s, and try to come to a consensus as to whether or not they serve as useful barometers for dietary preferences. Understanding nutritional requirements and communicating them in an effective way to the general public is vital. Cardiovascular disease is on the rise, diabetes is on the rise and every other relevant marker of metabolic syndrome is also on the rise. We not only need a better scientific representation of RDA’s, but we need more efficient and intuitive mediums to relay this information to the general public. This literature review focuses on four primary objections to the RDA’s, many of which were outlined by Russel in his treatment of the subject (Russell). 1) The methodology (epidemiology) regarding how the allowances are derived is faulty. 2) We seriously lack information on the confounding factors of epidemiology. 3) There is massive variation of needs between both groups and individuals. 4) Relevant endpoints have not been established when evaluating that a sufficient amount has been met. 5) Interaction between certain nutrients confounds findings. Nutrition scientists have been interested in optimizing health ever since the inception of the study. The first codified guide for nutrition intake was established in 1943 during World War II by the Food and Nutrition board. They named this outline “Recommended Dietary Allowances” and the basic structure of those recommendations is still maintained to this day. By evaluating the underlying theory involved in establishing the RDA’s during their genesis, we can establish whether or not they serve as a secure foundation for adequate nutrition. The reason the context of World War II is important is because the guidelines were originally developed “to determine in a time of possible shortage, what levels of nutrients were required to ensure that the nutrition of the people would be safeguarded.” (Mangino) It’s noteworthy to observe that the Food and Nutrition Boards’ intent was not to maximize health, but to avoid sickness. On the surface this could seem problematic, and it is a common criticism leveled at the RDA’s. However, upon closer examination the criticism seems to be unfounded, or at the very least minimally important. According to the Institute of Medicine, “It is evident that as early as 1952, an RDA committee was considering the potential health benefits of nutrient intakes above minimum requirements.” (Institute of Medicine) Although originally intending to solely stave off inadequate intake, the Food and Nutrition board acknowledged the potential pitfalls of this methodology. In response, they broadened their mission to “provide standards to serve as a goal for good nutrition.” (NRC) The board never claims to give advice for perfect nutrition and, and intentionally included “recommendation” as part of its nomenclature. Ultimately, this is something that should be taken into consideration, though not to be deemed too problematic. The far more compelling question is in regard to how the Food and Nutrition board actually established the levels of adequate nutrition in the first place. The primary medium used to study individuals in order to determine recommended daily allowances was epidemiology. The primary stated goal of epidemiological inquiries is “the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events... and the application of this study to the control of health problems.” (Principles of Epidemiology). Epidemiology is conducted through observational studies. The data for these studies is collected through various methods: nutrition surveys and data mining being the most common. After collecting and cleaning the data, analysis and statistical inference is then performed. The exact methods are outlined by the Food and Nutrition board. Though epidemiology is a data-driven discipline that utilizes scientific inquiry to demonstrate its findings, it comes with a myriad of problems that make accurate statistical inference incredibly difficult. The first thing that should be noted is that epidemiology holds no causal, or explanatory, power. Farmer identifies this in his criticism of the subject, The proper way to draw inference in the scientific discipline is to posit a hypothesis, set up an experiment, control for confounding factors and infer results. Due to the nature of observational studies, no treatments are actually being performed on a subject. Instead, epidemiology works backwards, observing the results and then inferring the treatments. This makes isolating causal factors nearly impossible, which is detrimental when attempting to evaluate nutritional need. In fairness to epidemiology, there are certain disciplines that attempt to control for these limitations. For example, the American Journal of Ophthalmology correctly identifies that many diseases are composed of multiple components, none of which can be identified as the sole cause. “Rather, it is a mosaic of components acting together (though not necessarily contemporaneously) that are required to produce disease.” Figure 1 below represents using this strain of thinking in order to identify a potential culprit for disease. Factor “A” appears in 3 of the observations, whereas factor “B” appears in 2 and factor “G” only appears in 1, suggesting Factor “A” is more likely to be causal.         Another response to the criticism of causation may be that although causation may not be technically inferred, the findings may still be teleologically useful. In other words, “the more scientific or logical definitions of causation seek to explain the world, whereas a goal of epidemiology is more practical: that is, to inform public health efforts to reduce morbidity and mortality.” (McGwin) Although both of these objections are a step in the right direction, the various methods to try to ameliorate the problem ultimately fail. The heart of the issue, causation, still isn’t properly addressed. With so many confounding factors, teleological arguments are dangerous. Likewise, when we are dealing with something as serious as nutritional requirements, randomized control trials should be the gold standard. The reason that proof of causation is so critical when dealing with dietetics and food nutrition is because there is a myriad of confounding factors that muddy that data. Taubes speaks to this issue bluntly in his writings on the pitfalls of epidemiology, “Many epidemiologists concede that their studies are so plagued with biases, uncertainties, and methodological weaknesses that they may be inherently incapable of accurately discerning such weak associations.” (Taubes) There are a multitude of confounding factors when considering epidemiological studies. However, the treatment of just 2 will be sufficient for this literature review: 1) Reporting issues 2) Interactions between different factors. Bad data will always lead to bad results, and the data that we use to evaluate the RDA’s (and answer most dietetic problems in general) is saturated with problems. The statistics we are interested in studying in a population are typically ascertained through food questionnaires. There are a few reasons this is problematic, the first of which being that memory is fallible. It’s absurd to expect precision, and. therefore reliability, when asking individuals questions such as “How many bananas have you eaten in the last month?” or “Over the course of the last six months, how often did you consume 2 teaspoons of sugar?” Pictured below in figure 2 is a good representation of a typical nutrition survey, demonstrating the obvious potential equivocations.        Unsurprisingly this is reflected in the literature. Inaccurate recall, underreporting of “unhealthy foods” and survey biases all contribute to faulty data. For example, Bedard found that, “Energy intake determined from self-reported dietary assessment methods may be underreported.” (Bedard) This is problematic because, as Livingstone noted on her treatment of nutrition surveys (Livingstons) When poor data is gathered through nutritional assessments riddled with biases, and then evaluated using shaky epidemiological methodologies – trying to infer causation through corollary statistics – you are unlikely to get useful results. All recommended daily allowances were based on this type of science. This is extremely problematic when deciding whether or not the RDA’s serve as accurate and useful metrics. The other problem that should be considered when evaluating epidemiological data is confounding factors. This encompasses 2 separate things: both dietary confounding factors and non-dietary confounding factors. The former will be treated elsewhere in this review, whereas the latter will be evaluated here. Recall that the method by which the RDAs were established was by “selecting healthy people who represent the segment of the population for which allowances were to be set, determining the average requirement... and then calculating an allowance to cover their needs.” (Institute of Medicine) The problem with this methodology, is there are a multitude of non-dietary factors that could qualify an individual as “healthy”. People that exercise, sleep, don’t smoke tobacco or drink alcohol are all going to be “healthier” individuals, which confounds the dietary component and makes isolating the nutrient we are interested in difficult. This is known as the “Healthy User Bias” and it can not only incorrectly show exaggerated correlation, but sometimes it can go so far as to report results that contradict randomized control trials. Shrank et al. studied this phenomenon extensively, explaining “numerous highly publicized observational studies of the effect of prevention on health outcomes have reported exaggerated relationships that were later contradicted by randomized controlled trials.” (Shrank) This is a crucial criticism of observational data (the heart of RDA establishment) and one that we have yet to find a good solution for. Each of us intuitively understands that some foods are nutritionally better than other foods. “Better” is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence, though. Better in what way? Without a parameter that specifies what we are measuring, propositions like X food is healthier than Y food don’t make much sense. Likewise, it’s impossible to determine what the optimal nutrient intake should be without some sort of hierarchical metric. This problem is openly admitted by the National Research Council This need for specificity further exacerbates the problem with the Food and Nutrition Boards original idea to find healthy individuals, study their nutrition habits and then extract out the results. There is no clear consensus as to what constitutes healthy even from a comprehensive perspective. Meanwhile, it becomes increasingly difficult when trying to pinpoint a specific micronutrient. In contemplating this dilemma, Kaaks suggests certain biological and physiological markers. Specifically, he argued “Biochemical markers are increasingly seen as measurements that may help to overcome some of the methodological problems in nutritional epidemiology. In practice this would involve determining what a good and bad biochemical metric for a specific micronutrient would be, gathering samples from the population you’d like to study, and then correlating the metric with the purported nutrient intake. This works in theory but is incredibly difficult in practice. Take cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) for example. We’ve observed that individuals with low levels of B12 are typically more tired. Therefore, we could use self reported “energy” as our metric, gather data regarding various levels of B12 intake, and establish the recommended intake of B12. The problem, of course, is there are several confounding factors. Sleep, stress, vitamin C, carnitine, sodium and caloric intake levels are all known contributors for energy levels To avoid this sort of problem, in keeping with Kaaks’ argument, instead we could select more delineated and measurable biological outcomes. In terms of B12 this would be something like an assessment of red blood cells or, even better, an actual measurement of serum B12. However, this isn’t possible within the framework of epidemiology, considering it is done through self-reported nutritional studies and aggregating pre-existing data. This is why nutritional science is so messy, and why epidemiological correlations cannot be taken at face value. It’s nearly impossible to isolate a singular explanatory variable (nutrient) and reasonably demonstrate it having causal power, when we can’t actually identify a response variable that isn’t confounded by other nutrients. Because of this, the data is susceptible to bias. Sackett, in his study of bias, catalogs nearly “35 different types of biases that arise during sampling and measurement” most of which are present in this type of epidemiological study (Sackett). When there is no consensus on what constitutes a good physiological endpoint, you can always stack the cards in your deck to demonstrate your a-priori hypothesis. Implicit biases are bound to creep in, muddying the data and not producing useful results. The third primary criticism of the RDAs, and their establishment, was the massive amount of variability found in nutrient needs among individuals. There are physiological difference that will be present among obvious biological divides: age, weight and gender being the immediate culprits. However, you will notice that all food labels (the primary resource for individuals calculating their daily intake) only report a “one size fits all” value for each micro and macronutrient. Surely the recommended daily allowance is different for a 10-year-old girl than for a 50-year-old mans. Though the RDAs were established in the 1930’s, this conundrum wasn’t even considered until as recently as a few decades ago. “During deliberations in the mid-1990’s the FNB decided to replace this single set of values with multiple sets of values... For designated age groups, physiological states (for example, pregnancy) and by sex. These values are collectively referred to as the DRI’s.” (National Agricultural Library). Putting aside the aforementioned implicit epidemiological problems with how the data was collected, as well as the new DRI’s not being easily accessible to the general public, there are other issues associated with variability in nutrient needs. For example, when establishing the recommended daily allowances, in order to account for variability, Beaton noted that the Food and Nutrition Board decided to set the recommendation two standard deviations above the mean. (Beaton) The rationale for doing this, is that when observations are normally distributed, two standard deviations above the mean accounts for roughly 98% of the population. By covering this high of a percentage of the population, they reasoned the nutrient recommendation would be sufficient. This is modeled in Figure 3: the standard normal (Gaussian) distribution below. There is a massive underlying problem with this methodology, though. The “Recommended Dietary Allowances: 10th Edition” points out itself that “there is little evidence that requirements for nutrients are normally distributed.” (NRC) The National research council backs this point illustrating, “The distribution of the iron requirements for women, for example, is skewed.” (NCR) All of the known dietary recommendations we have were currently formulated using a Gaussian assumption that we have little to no evidence for. In keeping with these criticisms, Butte designed an experiment in an attempt to evaluate the DRIs for breast-fed infants, and whether or not the claims of variability held up. He found, after 4 months that “A reevaluation of energy and protein intakes and allowances during infancy is merited”. (Butte) We can surmise from this treatment that not only is there massive variability between age groups, gender and age, but that even within constrained categories there is a level of flexible that is not accurately portrayed by a normal distribution. Further research needs to be done in order to accurately prescribe Previously we considered non-dietary related confounding factors present in epidemiological research. Similarly, there is another problem presented by how nutrients actually interact with each other. Willet, who has studied the difficulties in nutrition research extensively, notes “Studies in diet in relation to disease raise methodological challenges considerably more complicated than in most epidemiological investigations. Diet is not a single exposure, but rather a complex set of many intercorrelated continuous variables.” (Willet) He correctly identifies that nutrients are not independent random variables, rather they work together cohesively and each must be evaluated in context of the other. The clearest example of this phenomenon is Vitamin C and glucose. Santosh et. Al noted that “Vitamin C is structurally similar to glucose and may, therefore, compete with glucose for transportation into the cell.” (Santosh) In other words, the amount of Vitamin C an individual optimally requires, is going to be contingent on the amount of dietary glucose they ingest. We see this reflected in the literature, with Dakhale noting that “supplementation of Vitamin C reduces blood glucose.” Vitamin C is not the only example. Harvard medical school points out, non-exhaustively, a list of other nutrients that compete for absorption: vitamin D and calcium, sodium and potassium, B12 and folate, zinc and copper, niacin and tryptophan. (Harvard) The implication of this is crucial and needs to be understood by anyone studying epidemiological data and trying to derive causations. An individual, for example, eating a low carb diet is going to have completely different Vitamin C (and nutrients in general) requirements than an individual eating a high carb diet. A critical distinction needs to be drawn between absorption and consumption in order for daily allowances to be properly recommended.        After considering the primary criticisms that have been leveled at the recommended daily allowances, and their establishment, we can conclude that some are well founded, while others are not. Labeling, and communication of daily allowances, is a minor problem. Similarly, it’s troubling to note that we don’t have good evidence for the Gaussian distribution of nutrient needs; however, when considering how liberally the Nutrition board was with their recommendations, this hardly seems like an immediate concerrn. However, other issues addressed in this work are severe, and we don’t presently have viable solutions. The pitfalls of epidemiology – nutritional surveys, bias, lack of explanatory power, confounding factors – make the validity of recommended daily allowances seem extremely unlikely. If all of the methodological pitfalls are taken into account, they may still have teleological utility, but should not be held up as scientifically sound. In the midst of an obesity epidemic, a nutrient deficiency epidemic and a discorded eating epidemic, we need better data. The recommended daily allowances, as established by the Food and Nutrition Board, do not sufficiently establish, or communicate, accurate nutrient needs for the general public. In order to help combat the current health crisis, this literature review concludes that re-evaluation of the methodological approach in establishing recommendations needs to take place. The exponential distribution strongly resembles certain other distributions - for example, the poisson and geometric distributions - but contains key differences that allow statisticians to solve problems that would otherwise be difficult. Historically the exponential distribution was created to model scenarios involving time, making it extremely useful and one of the most common distribution models. Specifically, it is representative of the waiting time until the first event in a random process occurs. Examining the exponential distribution’s relationship with other distributions helps us understand its utility and properties further. The poisson distribution, for example, is closely related with the exponential; the key discrepancy being their units of measurement. The exponential uses “length of time until a certain occurrence” as its unit of measurement, whereas the poisson measures the “number of occurrences within a given time interval.” Similarly, a gamma distribution is simply the sum of mutually independent exponential random variables, and the geometric distribution is the exponential’s discrete complement. Concrete examples of when an exponential distribution should be used could be instructive. Common instances would be the length of time until a volcano erupts, or the amount of time a customer spends within a store until they buy something. One specific application that arises from the exponential distribution is the concept of reliability; in other words, a prediction of time before a product breaks down. The lifetime of a lightbulb, and how long before a certain piece of hardware goes faulty, can both be modeled by the exponential distribution. One last property that should be mentioned, due to it being completely unique to the exponential distribution, is the concept of “memoryless.” This means that “the probability that the event will happen within a time interval is independent of how much time has already elapsed without the event happening.” (Taboga) An intuitive example of this property would be the length of time until you get into a car crash. Your probability of getting into an accident is not contingent on how long it has been since your last car crash. You are no more likely now, than you were a year ago, than you will be in 5 years. The PDF of the exponential distribution is of the form (Lambda * e ^ (-lambda * x). Lambda, in this case, is the rate of which it takes for a certain event to occur. Given that the exponential distribution models time, it can take on any positive value. There are a few conditions that need to be satisfied in order for a probability density function to be considered valid though: 1) All values of fx(x) need to be positive 2) The area of integration under the curve needs to equal to one. Pictured below is a graph of the probability density curve for an exponential function with four different values for lambda: .5, 1, 2 and 4 respectively. Notice that for every x value, there is an associated positive probability, satisfying our first requirement. Also, regardless of lambda, if you integrate underneath the curve you get a value equal to one. The center and spread of the curve are both affected by the parameter (lambda) passed into the density function. The shape, however, is unchanging; regardless of the value of lambda, the same basic exponential shape is maintained. As lambda gets smaller, the center of the distribution shifts to the right, whereas the spread increases. Intuitively, when lambda increases the distribution shifts to the left and the        spread decreases. Unlike other distributions, this is maintained regardless of whether or not lambda drops below 1. Also, given the exponential distribution can only take values of lambda greater than 0, a negative value will never be passed in. We know definitionally that we can derive the cumulative density function (CDF) by integrating our probability density function (PDF) from 0 to infinity. There are three requirements for a CDF to be valid: 1) The distribution must be non-decreasing 2) As x approaches negative infinity, the value of Fx(x) approaches zero 3) As x approaches positive infinity, the value of Fx(x) approaches 1. The CDF of the exponential distribution is pictured below, with lambda taking on 4 values: .3, .7, 1 and 2 respectively. Based on the graph above, we see that each of the 3 requirements for a proper cumulative density function are fulfilled. The function is non-decreasing, and approaches 1 and 0 when approaching positive and negative infinity respectively. Unsurprisingly, the center and spread of the curve change when the lambda parameter is adjusted. As lambda increases, the center is shifted to the left on the spread decreases, with the opposite being true as lambda decreases. Similar to the PDF, the shape remains unchanged. The expected value “E(X)” of the exponential distribution can be derived by taking the integral of “x” multiplied by the probability density function, with respect to x. The actual derivation is pictured below, resulting in an expected value of “1 over lambda”. The variance (Var) of “X” can be found in a similar way to the expected value: the shortcut formula being the E(X^2), minus the E(X)^2. The E(X^2) can be found the same way as the E(X) in the previous derivation, only substituting in X^2 for X. The full derivation of the Var(X) is pictured below. We can also derive the moment generating function of an exponential distribution in order to obtain the expected value of x (among other moments). In order to do this, we simply take the typical formula for a moment generating function, substituting in the probability density function of the exponential distribution, and then solving this integration. Ultimately, our moment generating function ends up being lambda divided by lambda minus t. After we have obtained the moment generating function, we can then use that function to derive the expected value of an exponential. To do this, we simply take the first derivative of the moment generating function. The derivation is pictured below. The maximum likelihood estimator for the exponential distribution can be derived with 4 relatively easy steps, each of which is demonstrated in the graphic below. The first step is obtaining the likelihood function by obtaining the product of the pdf, with x1 to xn values of x. Then, in order to make taking the derivative easier, we take the log of the likelihood function. After we’ve obtained the log likelihood, we take the derivative with respect to lambda. Finally, we set that equation equal to zero, and solve for lambda; which in turn becomes our MLE. For my example of an exponential distribution, I observed how long it took for any individual to go to the water fountain inside my local gym. The exponential is an appropriate distribution, given that it models the amount of time required for a certain event to happen. The observations are pictured below. Intuitively, these values appear to follow an exponential distribution. Most of the values are relatively low, hovering around 7 to 14 seconds. However, there are a few larger values that seem to grow exponentially: 51 seconds and 48 seconds being good examples. Graphically this hypothesis is beared out, with the histogram of the data being pictured below, overlaid with a line for the probability density function. This demonstrates that our data does indeed follow an exponential distribution.Given that the distribution is used as a derived distribution for inference, we can create a simulation of exponential values, obtain statistics and graph the data appropriately. In R, I simulated data from an exponential distribution using the “rexp()” function - with 1000 observations and a rate of .05. Unsurprisingly, this seems to strongly mirror the data collected at the drinking fountain. The mean of the simulated data was 19.12, whereas the mean of the real data was 19.97. This makes sense, when you consider the mean of an exponential distribution is one divided by lambda; in this case one divided by .05 which is equal to 20. Pictured below is the graph of the simulated data, along with the underlying probability density function.


The obligatory reveal scene – where bman slowwwwly walks out from the shadows (thud, thud, thud) and then beats the ever living hell out of that street thug – nearly made me cum… But unfortunately that metaphor is intentional and relevant because, much łike in real life, the climax came way too soon.

Don’t get me wrong, anytime Batman is on screen I’m happy. Even Batman v. Superman – which is an objectively bad movie – was an overwhelmingly positive experience for me, and “The Batman” ™️ wasn’t any different. The character is just that powerful at this point.

Because I am absolutely dripping in objectivity, though, I have to put the fangirl part of me aside. Not only did this movie not meet any of my (albeit high) expectations, but it went so far as to flip the entire Batman archetype on its head – which was at best annoying, and at worst outright insulting.

Narrative driven films are okay. Nolan’s trilogy (and his films in general) are propelled by ideas, rather than people, and that works really well if done correctly. However, you can’t spend łittle to no time on character development (in a 3 hour movie, mind you) and then expect the emotional moments to hit home.

What are this iteration of Bruce Wayne’s motivations…. ? Do we know anything about him other than the implicit fact that his parents died? Why is he ~vengeance~? What about Selina? Is she given anything to do in this movie other than be hot?

If you’re going to make Thomas Wayne doing business with Falcone – and Carmine being Selina’s Father – major plot points, then we need *some* sort of context regarding their relationships with their fathers.

Instead, the moments fall completely flat and only pad an already long runtime. We can’t sympathize with them because the emotional stakes were never explored.

I mean seriously – what character development even occurred as a consequence? Bman went from angsty and broody to…. A łittle bit *more* angsty and broody?

Speaking of Bruce Wayne being angsty and broody… What the hell happened to Batman’s alter ego?

I’m torn, because on one hand I think the facade of “Billionaire, Playboy, Philanthropist” is actually fundamental to the psychology and mythos of Batman. This is one of the reasons the Two-Face character has stuck – him and Bman are two sides of the same coin – so it’s a bit jarring to see Bruce Wayne publicly acting like a tormented recluse.

On the other hand – I like when directors exercise creative liberty and push characters in novel directions. Dating back to Michael Keaton’s 1989 performance, 10 different people have dawned the black cape, so it’s nice to keep things fresh. I’ll give you a pass on this one – but that’s the *only* pass you’re getting, because holy ballsack did you guys screw up this character.

Although they were a bit lighter in tone, RDJ’s Sherlock Holmes gave a beautiful blueprint for how a detective movie should operate. Sherlock is clearly brilliant, but throughout the film every time he makes headway on the case, the antagonist mitigates the move – all the way up until the big reveal where you find out the detective was 5 steps ahead the entire time.

In a show down between the riddler and the world’s greatest detective – Bman didn’t even deserve a seat at the table. He lost. Straight up lost – and was just playing catch up the entire time. Riddler ran intellectual circles around him, and then when he had his fun, literally turned himself in.

The entire time I kept waiting for the “AHA!“ moment, where we found out that Batman actually wasn’t getting his ass kicked… And it never came.

Even the last riddle he literally figures it out because a convenient police officer who conveniently worked as a carpenter was conveniently at the crime scene at the same time and conveniently brought up the murder weapon.

All of these criticisms pale in comparison to the fact that these writers hate the Batman.

The movie opens with a voiceover of Bruce essentially saying “I don’t get it. Despite all my efforts, crime is still rampant. Nothing I’m doing is working.” Then in the (technically) climactic moment of the film, Batman hears a henchman parrot his opening phrase (I am vengeance) and realizes him and the Riddler were one and the same.

Because of this he sacrifices himself, falls into the water, and comes out metaphorically reborn – proceeding to lead a group of struggling civilians out of the flood and into the sunset.

They tease the Bman/Riddler parallel throughout the film. Both keep extensive journals, dress in costumes, are disillusioned with the state of Gotham, and take things into their own hands by targeting the corrupt through questionable methods outside of the law.

This is actually a *super* cool premise, whose moral ambiguity would have made the film that much more compelling. Instead of dealing with that tension, though, they finished the film in the worst way possible.

1. They flipped the Batman character on its head

2. They turned Riddler into a generic evil baddie

The problem with Batman’s character arc is the *entire premise* of the archetype is that he *IS* vengeance.

That’s literally – the point – of f*cking – Batman.

He’s a lonely, cynical and jaded individual – with every superficial thing anyone could ever want (billionaire, genius level IQ, perfect physique) – but in an attempt to cope with loss, he spends his nights beating the criminal underworld to a pulp with his bare hands.

This moral tension is part of what makes the character so compelling, and so relatable. Batman has never been a hero, he’s an anti-hero – but ending of the film is trying to turn him into a boy scout which is entirely antithetical to the mythos in the first place.

On top of all of this, despite the obvious similarities between Edward and the Bat, there is one key discrepancy – Bruce doesn’t kill, while Riddler does regularly. This is actually relevant and could have been explored.

As a quick aside (before i get into the Riddler) I wanna talk about the “crime is still rampant” quote, because this is actually an indispensable part of a world that contains the Caped Crusader. Batman *needs* crime – just as much as the crazies are obsessed with Bman.

Remember the Lego Batman movie where Bman becomes depressed due to the lack of crime? It’s played off a joke – but it’s integral to the character. There’s a reason he tacitly lets Joker escape from arkham asylum again, and again, and again, and… It’s part of a sadistic game that he can’t stop playing.

Not only that, but a hero dressing up as a bat actively encourages reciprocity – which is why there are so many cooky villains putting on costumes as well. The larger the batman symbol becomes the more baddies there are to take on the challenge.

The Riddler character for the first 2 acts of the movie was methodical, and only targeted individuals with direct culpability in the political corruption ruining the city. His motivations were clear: stop the lies, and bring the perpetrators into the light.

I already mentioned above, but the interweaving of him and Bman’s identities together was brilliant – both of them are disillusioned orphans who find fulfillment in tackling corruption outside of legal jurisdiction.

Consequently, it was fun watching the two work in tandem, with Riddler pulling strings behind the scenes and Bman doing the dirty work. Honestly – under certain circumstances – you can almost imagine Ed taking on an “Oracle” or “Guy in the Chair” type of role for Bman.

That’s what made the pairing so compelling – like any good story should do, it didn’t strawman its antagonist.

*Is* Batman the same as Riddler? What makes one morally justified, and the other culpable? Could the 2 bridge their world views and work together? Riddler views himself as guilty and turned himself in… Should Batman do the same?

This film literally would have been better if it ended after Riddler turned himself in. I’m not talking “rewrite so this could be the ending” – i mean *literally* just chop off the last 30 minutes of the movie. If you do that the audience has to deal with the moral ambiguity.

Instead this supposedly smart movie flips both characters on their head, and then holds our hands and walks us towards the message they want, “Riddler bad, Batman good.”

The ending turns the Riddler into every other generic marvel villain baddie – which runs entirely contrary to his previously established motives. He spent the entire film targeting specific perpetrators – but then arbitrarily decides to flood the entire city because the writers needed a high stakes third act.

Considering the Riddler was literally an orphan – motivated by helping the dispossessed – it’s completely incoherent for him to flood the city. The down stream consequences of natural disasters and mass destabilization always affect low-income and deprived populace first – while the powerful have the resources to recover.

We have a joker problem. Ever since the all-time Ledger performance, every Batman iteration ad nauseam has required either a Joker, or an unhinged Joker stand in with a different name (a la Paul Dano).

It became painfully obvious during the jail scene (Ave Mariaaaaaaaaa) and then outright comical during the final Arkham Asylum scene – as we watched both characters perform a nearly identical maniacal laugh.

I mean it makes sense, the formula worked the first time – and at the end of the day movies *are* a product – so you might as well capitalize on the cultural relevance of the character… But it’s becoming tiresome.

Since 2008 Joker has been in Suicide Squad, Joker, Gotham, The Lego Batman Movie (it counts 😠🔪), and a cameo in The Batman. The Joker was the main villain in *every* Arkham Video game (if you care about that) and Lex Luther in Batman V. Superman was the functional equivalent of a Joker with blond hair.

Speaking of Jesse Eisenberg…

1. Now You See Me 2’s villain is a perfect example of the Joker fetish bleeding into other cinematic universes.

2. Can you imagine if he had played Lex Luther (or this Riddler 👀) the same way he played Zuckerberg in The Social Network?

A character who’s modus operandi is their intelligence doesn’t need to be deranged or over the top. In terms of this film, “jokerfying” the Riddler was at best gratuitous and at worst positively counter productive. A more composed and grounded Ed would have fit the tone and genre of the movie better, and still could have been intimidating as f*ck (a la Gus Fring). Instead we just got a Joker who “had taken high school Spanish classes and spent way too much time on Twitch.”

In terms of the actual riddles – I thought the first one was good 🙂 “He lies still” got me excited for the rest of the film, but unfortunately it was all downhill from there.

In a detective movie I want to feel in on the game – it helps me root for the sleuther (made up word) and sucks me into the movie. However, this movie was more about us watching The Batman play, instead of the audience trying to piece things together side by side before the reveal.

No clues were given to contextualize any of the riddles, and frankly the last 2 weren’t that good. “Drive”? Eh. 🤷‍♀️. The last Riddle was particularly frustrating – because multiple viable interpretations of the Riddle is *not* indicative of Batman’s inferior intellect (even tho Bman did get nerfed in this movie), it just proves it was a bad riddle.

Bring him out into the light? Please… I get it’s a double entendre, but there is *NO* reason for Bruce to know that means “bring Carmine Falcone out into the street, underneath this *specific* light post.” 🙄

I didn’t feel łike there was a strong unifying theme throughout the film – all I can think of is “stop the lies” and “vengeance is bad”. The latter one, as i already described, is antithetical to the Batman. The former, however, I think is at least interesting at face value, but it wasn’t realized throughout the film. There were no instances of characters lying, understanding it to be wrong, and then growing as a consequence.

This post was primarily about articulating why it was that I left the movie theater feeling so unsettled. Now that I feel like I’ve done that, though, łet me hit some of the points that were overwhelmingly positive about the film, and then close with some minor criticisms.

• Colin Ferrel’s penguin was captivating/brilliant.

• Gorgeous cinematography.

• Paul Dano and Robert Pattinson were great, despite my reservations about the direction the writers took the characters.

• The reveal / fight scene with Bman 😍

• Didn’t show the broken necklace scene for the 18th time (even tho i would have liked *some* context / backstory)

The easiest minor criticism of the movie is that it’s just too damn long. Length, in and of itself, is not a bad thing – the problem is this movie *feels* long. The pacing of the first hour and a half is static – with that time being spent almost exclusively on the first 2 riddles, which could have been an entire movie by itself.

There’s at least 2 scenes that, in my mind, could be *entirely* cut from the movie and nothing would be lost: the car chase scene, and literally the entire third act (flood scene). The former was just fan service (in a Batmobile that wasn’t even cool?) while the latter was narratively idiotic.

Finally…

• Batman and Catwoman have no romantic or sexual chemistry and I’m getting sick of movies thinking they can just put 2 hot people on screen, not give them any substantial reasons to łike eachother, and expect it to work.

• I know it’s a plot hole we just have to accept at this point, but this Bruce Wayne is so obviously Batman. First thing I thought when I saw the Bman was “that’s Robert Pattinson’s jaw!”

• We had to watch him break into the Iceberg Lounge ™️ łike 4 separate times.

• NOBODY hits the lower half of his face with the 300,000 bullets?

• RIP Alfred (almost) (blown up by a bomb)

• RIP Electoral Mayor (almost) (shot by a sniper)

• RIP Batman (almost) (shotgun to the chest)

What can the late great Ke$ha teach us about interstellar dynamics and evolution? I’m not sure, I’m not an astrophysicist. But her 2010 hit single “Your Love is my Drug” is a perfect segue-way into the introduction to today’s blog.

“I don’t care what people say, the rush is worth the price I pay, I get so high when you’re with me, then crash and crave you when you leave… Because your love is my drug.” – Kesha Rose Sebert

The “Love is like a Drug” metaphor isn’t unique.

And then, of course, there’s this gem from Camila Cabello. It communicates the same idea – but it’s so catchy i have to include it 😩

“Something must have gone wrong in my brain, got your chemicals all in my veins, feeling all the highs feeling all the pain. Blurring all the lines you intoxicate me – just like nicotine, heroine Morphine…”

This comparison saturates our contemporary music and, I think, is reflective of the colossal shift in our cultural understanding of “what love is” over the last century and a half. 

When you first engage in a romantic relationship there’s a neurochemical cocktail that hits hard, and it hits fast. Almost like a ~drug~. The problem, however, is after the honeymoon phase of the first 9 months, the feelings inevitably fade. We interpret this as having “fallen out of love” – so we discard the partner and chase the newer better high. 

This blog isn’t about that phenomenon. I already wrote a poem about that 🙂 Rather, it’s about how we got here in the first place, and what the implications of this ideological transformation are. 

« Romanticism »

The European emphasis on emotion and individualism at the advent of the 19th century gave rise to what might be the single greatest obstacle to contemporary happiness in relationships: Victorian Romanticism. The songs mentioned above, and their subsequent messages, all stem from this romantic movement.

Love as we presently understand it (romantic love) is a relatively novel idea. François de La Rochefoucauld, an old French author, had this to say about love, “There are some people who would have never fallen in love, if they hadn’t heard there was such a thing.”

It’s a bit cynical (these emotions are real, and they are powerful) but at a high level it gets across the right point – so much about how we view, interpret and experience love is culturally dependent. 

As a consequence, we’ve been programmed to believe some pretty silly ideas – but we’re so contextually steeped into it that these silly ideas are implicitly accepted as Gospel. Challenging them is threatening a foundational, axiomatic belief – and people do *not* like their core beliefs threatened.

« Frozen is so Meta »

I chose the title to this blog post intentionally. The brilliance of Frozen’s “Love is an Open Door” is that upon first watch the song actually resonates. This is exactly the type of romance we’re culturally primed to eat up, and it feels natural and expected it in a Disney movie. But of course the movie then goes on to subvert our expectations by revealing Hans to be a manipulative Machiavellian that’s weaponizing romance for his own selfish motives.

The song is making fun of the naive fantasies of romantics, while literally *pretending* to be the exact idea it’s making fun of – and the fact that it doesn’t ring any alarm bells in the viewer (the twist totally works) is emblematic of just how engrained this world view actually is.

« The Soul Mate »

One silly thing that Romanticism champions as one of its core tenants is the idea of “the soul mate”.  Romantics dream of the day – whether they’re in a coffee shop, or on a train – when they lock eyes with someone across the room and get a very very special feeling. The universe has finally conspired to bring them together, and this special special feeling is confirmation. 

Of course this sounds romantic (because it is) but this strain of thinking actually leads to some pretty negative down stream consequences. As soon as you bring fate into the equation you’re sneaking divinity through the back door. 

As our societies have become increasingly secular, love has simultaneously been elevated and held up as a God. You see this reflected in our use of language, as the word “angel” wasn’t used to describe a romantic partner until the 15th century, and wasn’t popularized until the 18th.

Deity has certain properties that we see reflected in the expectations romanticism has for its lovers: omniscient, all-loving and omnipotent, with redemption being the logical conclusion of the triad.

« Omniscience »

If you were to poll 100 people and ask them what the key to maintaining good relationships is, I’m sure 95 would respond with something along the lines of “communication”. This is ironic, and frankly funny, considering romanticism outright rejects the advocation of communication – suggesting that if you have to talk, that this is a betrayal of love. 

I don’t think I’m being hyperbolic – this idea is foundational and baked into the equation right off the bat. Remember, when you find “the one” you are going to feel the very very special feeling. They’re going to feel the very very special feeling too. No words need to be communicated because it’s mutually understood that destiny has intervened. 

Of course, like all the other tenants of romanticism, this is reflected by our language. Think about the lyrics from these popular contemporary romantic songs…

“You reflect me, I love that about you, and if I could I would look at us all the time. Cause I don’t wanna lose you now, I’m lookin’ right at the other half of me. It’s like you’re my mirror, my mirror staring back at me.”

“That’s what I was gonna say! I’ve never met someone who thinks so much like me! Jinx! Jinx again! Our mental synchronization can have but one explanation. You and I were just meant to be.”

“Don’t know if I could ever be without you cause boy you complete me… Cause you’re the apple to my pie, you’re the straw to my berry… Cause you’re the one for me, and I’m the one for you, you take the both of us and we’re the perfect two.”

If you and your partner truly are 2 sides of the same coin, there should never be a need for uncomfortable, straightforward communication. In romanticism we expect our partners to be both omniscient *and* on the same page – which is detrimental because conflict is inevitable.

You’re going to disagree – even (especially) about things that are completely banal. This isn’t a sign that love has gone awry – it’s normal, and healthy, and should be handled like adults.

Instead we want our partners to be able to intuit through the bedroom door why we’re upset. “If you really loved me, you would know why I’m upset.” If you accept the tenant that your significant other should be a “mirror” that completes you, this type of statement is the logical conclusion.

Speaking of completionism, here’s one of the most iconic movie moments for romantics – standing in stark contrast to a (albeit a bit cynical) more grounded, realistic representation of love.

« Omnipotence »

The day you meet “the one” is the first day of your life. All of the perennial feelings of loneliness and insecurity that have plagued you your entire life will be ameliorated. “Say goodbye to the pain of the past, love is an open door.”

We tacitly expect love to be the solution to life’s inherent suffering, so after a few months (the honeymoon phase wears off) when we find ourselves feeling lonely, we conclude it was never “true” love in the first place. “If they were really the one, I wouldn’t feel so lonely.” 

Let me be clear, I think a good romantic partner can and should elevate your well being – but we’re banking on something that isn’t feasible.

I know it sounds heretical, but for almost all of human history we didn’t marry for “love” – we married for reason. Marriage was considered a post of responsibility and the role of a partner was primarily one of child rearing. Partners were typically chosen based on pragmatism and utility: families were close, it made financial sense, you would raise good kids etc… 

Marrying to “make you happy” is a relatively new idea –  largely a consequence of massive technological renovations and an increasingly individualistic culture. 

I am *NOT* arguing that these changes are necessarily bad – but it contextualizes how radical the ideological transformation we’ve gone through actually is. In keeping with the idea of “Omnipotence” – think about all of the roles we now expect our contemporary partners to fill.

Romantic lover, sexual partner, financial teammate, potential parent… However, the most illustrative example is the “best friend” role that’s become a staple in our romantic vernacular. You hear it everywhere! “They’re my best friend. I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with my best friend.” Etc… 

Don’t get me wrong, I value friendship, and think it should be the basis of any good relationship between individuals – but “best friend” has always been a distinct role separate from your partner.

The way you hangout and talk with your bros or your girlfriends should be different than the way you do with your romantic partner. They give you things that a lover can’t and that’s okay.

By ascribing the “Best Friend” role to our romantic partners we’re inadvertently putting unrealistic, God-like expectations on them. They can’t do and be everything. Chewy fills needs in Han that Leia never could, a Leslie from Parks and Rec needs an Ann, and Nala is not Timon and Pumba – nor should she be. 

I’m pontificating a bit, but I think this point is crucial. Instead of having clear expectations of what we’re looking for in a partner, romanticism has turned them into a weird amalgam of all things good – where they should fulfill any and all social roles. As a consequence, if you still feel like some of your needs aren’t being met in life – or you’re still lonely – it must be a sign that your partners isn’t “the one”.

Addendum: this is one reason the “cool girl” trope has become so prominent (i.e Jennifer Lawerence).

« Omni-Loving »

Finally there is, what I believe to be, the most damaging attribute that we ascribe to our illusory deified partners… We expect them to be all loving – warts and all. 

“All of me loves all of you, love your curves and all your edges, all your perfect imperfections. Give your all to me, I’ll give my all to you, you’re my end and my beginning cause even when I lose I’m winning.”

“When I see your face there’s not a thing that I would change, cause you’re amazing just the way you are. And when you smile the whole world stops and stares for a while, cause girl you’re amazing just the way you are.“ 

None of us are what we could be – we each have quirks and bad habits, most of which we are probably incognizant of. One of the reasons we are so un-self aware is because nobody else has ever been bothered to tell us. The uncomfortable conflict isn’t worth it to a friend or a family member. When you are dating somebody, though, these idiosyncrasies are amplified and inescapable.

Romanticism has normalized victim blaming. “If you *really* loved me, you would love *all* of me.” The burden of change has been put on the person who has to deal with the imperfections, rather than the person creating the conflict.

I’m painting in broad strokes – we absolutely need to be patient, empathetic and understanding of our partners imperfections. There’s certainly times where “shut up, grow up and deal with it” is the right attitude – even though I’m advocating for loving correction. 

The problem is romanticism has swung the pendulum completely in one direction – where not loving *everything* about a person is a sign that love has failed, rather than an inevitable part of any relationship between 2 people that are different.

Instead of recognizing that we can be better, and should want to be better, romanticism pushes us to grow resentful towards our partner whenever they don’t accept the ugly parts of us. This is nihilistic and gross – people can be awful – but we’re so attached to our imperfections that we identify them as a part of *us* so a rejection of them is a rejection of us, and a betrayal of love.

« Redemption »

Ultimately romanticism is looking for a Christ figure – who comes in through divine intervention, understands us perfectly, loves us regardless and has the power to redeem us from our previously dark, loveless, and lonely lives. 

« I’ve Fallen and I Can’t Get Up »

As a consequence of love being “divine” – and in keeping with the neurochemical cocktail present in the honeymoon phase – romantics rely almost exclusively on instinct when choosing a partner, rather than reason. 

The special special love feeling is due to fate – which is why the lyrics to arguably the most popular love song of all time, are about being helpless in the face of true love.

“Wise men say only fools rush in, but I can’t help falling in love with you. Shall I stay? Would it be a sin, if I can’t help falling in love with you? Like a river flows surely to the sea – darling so it goes, some things are meant to be. Take my hand, take my whole life too, for I can’t help falling in love with you.” 

The “falling” language is intentional. For romantics there’s nothing you can do about it – who you love is out of your control… The truth is you can “fall in love” with *a lot* of people, and relatively easily… As per my last email, I wrote a poem about it 🙂 you should read it 🙂

The point is romanticism has crowded out reason in the decision making process, and has conflated”being in love” (the drug-like, first couple months) with “love” – which I believe is something else entirely.

« I ❤ Romance »

To conclude, let me be very clear – despite alllll of that, I like romance. I AM PRO ROMANCE! I’m grateful we live in a day and age where we can afford the luxury of having it – where we *don’t* just choose partners based on their plot of land, or your dad doing business with their dad.

Romanticism has opened up avenues of experience that were never accessible to older generations. I get just as giddy as the next guy listening to a love song and thinking about what could be when that special person finds their way into my life. 

Here’s my problem though – romance should be a flavor, not the main course. Good romantic chemistry can heighten relationships to new, maybe even euphoric places, but we can’t let it cloud our judgement. 

We need to be more pragmatic when making one of the most important decisions in our lives (who to marry) – and we *have* to temper our unrealistic expectations.

« What is Love? (Baby Don’t Hurt Me) »

I know the infatuation phase feels really good- it hits all the right romantic buttons. It’s sad when it inevitably ends (falling out of love) but I’m here to argue that not only is this natural, but it’s actually good.

Being “in love” is a good thing. It fosters attachment, makes us feel so good, and opens our eyes to the beauty of them – and even the broader world around us. It’s obviously better than dispassionate lust, or self-centered loneliness, but it isn’t the *best* thing.

Falling in love is only the catalyst to something even more beautiful. Just because you fall out of love (and you will) doesn’t mean that you have to stop *loving*. It’s this second type of love – the real, intentional, noble type of love – that, if anything, should be viewed as divine.

Romanticism bails as soon as the Disney phase ends. When “all of me” no longer loves “all of you” – love has failed and there is no longer utility in the relationship.

Real love, however, promises to continue loving *despite* their flaws.

“I will choose to love you, even when I am no longer in love with you.”

In the most openly sexual climate in human history – how did sex become so unsexy?

Celebrity hotness used to be distant and awe-inspiring. The only way you could get recognized on a global scale was to be an actor or a singer, and the list of acceptable “celebrity crush” answers was single digits. Nowadays, however, somebody is just as likely to tell you a D-list celebrity TikToker you’ve never heard of. 

Given the globalization of Social Media, hot people are *everywhere*. You used to need talent, an agent, a friend in the industry and 20 years of hard work to have a chance at recognition. Now all you need is natural lighting and an iPhone. 

(Hot Take) Part of the grossness of modern beauty standards is that they ARE attainable – all you need is access to resources. Have you seen Kylie Jenner pre-transformation? 

I see more hot people in a day than my grandparents saw in a lifetime; most of them legitimately prettier than any A-list celebrity. We’ve inflated the currency, subsequently diminishing it’s value. 

No is the sexiest word in the human language – and we’ve become far too prone to disclosure. I don’t mean *literally* the word no (that sounds rapey and non-consenting) rather an embodied version of the word. Alluring people know how to balance being withholding and unavailable with teasing, flirting and signaling interest. 

Instead we’ve opted for complete divulgence – showcasing our naked bodies for social currency; and ironically it’s soooo unsexy. Increasing the frequency or intensity of any stimulus dampens the consumer’s dopaminergic response during subsequent intakes. Combine the revealing nature of contemporary influencers with easily accessible, rampant porn consumption, and you’ll get a culture completely desensitized to any and all things sexy. 

Despite living in a purportedly “pro-sex” culture, we are still overwhelmingly sex-negative. Both the political left *and* right focus their attention almost exclusively on the negative aspects – making healthy models of sexual discourse nearly impossible to come by.

The right *only* talks about the dangerous aspects of sex. Even “under the right circumstances” (marriage) the whole conversation still has an ascetic overtone –  with pleasure being adjacent to sin and corruption. This is one explanation for why so many people that grow up in overtly religious environments still struggle with post-nuptial feelings of shame and guilt. There‘s no room for actual, hot, good sex – łet alone kinky sex.

The left (somehow?) is equally antagonistic. Sex is only viewed in terms of its weaponization in a massive power struggle: coercion, manipulation, harassment, grooming etc…

What healthy models of sex do we have to turn to? Everything is either hollywoodized, performative or pornographic. I can’t think of a single realistic sex scene in cinema. All of our actors and influencers are objectively pretty – but none of them *feel* sexy. 

Sex actually *doesn’t* sell. The commodification of sex isn’t selling “fucking” – it’s selling “fuckability”. This is why there’s a perennial frustration over the objectification of women. Good sex – between consenting adults with romantic chemistry – can’t be advertised, commercialized or monetized.

“Anyone talking about sex that’s mutually pleasurable, spiritually uplifting, and that meaningfully connects people is seen as contrarian or subversive. Sex positivity, throughout most of history and equally in 2021, is counter-cultural.” – @yashkaf

With apps łike Tinder and Bumble shrinking the cost of rejection to functionally zero, and presenting an unprecedented scope of opportunity, intuitively you’d think that casual sex rates would have skyrocketed. They haven’t. 

The amount of men having sex follows a pareto distribution. Similar to how the top 1% of the population owns 43% of the wealth, a few men in every area are having *all* the sex – while everybody else is having *none*.

Generally women are far more selective and trepidatious about hooking up than men are. Considering the relative risk involved for each party this should make sense. *Generally* (again) (emphasis added) women only pick from the top and men will fuck anything with a hole, so, when it rains it pours and the rich get richer.

Honestly I don’t think it’s that great for the select few either. Part of the allure for the machiavellian types has always been the feeling of accomplishment associated with a successful hookup. Even the thrill of the chase, in the ultimately empty encounters, has been essentially neutered by dating apps. 

There’s no need to invest time, attention or resources into a girl when you could just find another one with a few lazy swipes. Sex has never been easier – casual hookups have never been more accessible to the 1%. “That which is achieved too easily is esteemed too lightly.” – Thomas Payne. 

Oh btw, all those men that aren’t having sex? They’re watching porn. Which, of course, is an absolute travesty when it comes to sex-positivity as well. 

The least interesting reason we’ve become so sexless – but arguably the most fixable – isn’t psychological, but biochemical and physiological in nature. We don’t have the same sex drive that we used to. We’re so sick. Everybody already knows about the obesity epidemic, I don’t need to pontificate, but I think it’s directly correlated with the sex epidemic as well. 

A lowering tide drops all boats – and subcutaneous fat isn’t the only byproduct of our gross contemporary diets. Erectile dysfunction rates are *skyrocketing*. So are eating disorders and crash diets – both of which severely dampen (oftentimes unrecoverably) your libido. Your body isn’t worried about it’s next orgasm when it’s in survival mode. 

Part of what has made sex so hot historically is that there *were* taboos surrounding its “improper” use. The untouchability of the idea created a seductiveness in crossing a line – and that only made the experience (whether right or wrong) that much hotter. Nowadays nothing is off limits. Hell – I read an article literally in mainstream Psychology Today a few weeks ago that was advocating cheating on your partner to strengthen the relationship (which is so oxymoronic it’s some form of miracle). 

As standards surrounding sexual morality collapse, the thrill of sexual irreverence falls with it. I think one of the reasons incest porn has proliferated so substantially is because it’s one of the only true taboos we have left. Which, as a side note, leads me to another (horrifying) hot take… I fear we’ll get to the point where adult-child sex goes from wrong, to taboo, to euphemized, to tolerated, to accepted and then finally to advocated.

Not only is sexual promiscuity becoming increasingly normalized – but the consequences of hookups are severely attenuated at this point. The invention of things like the pill, condoms and plan B (all of which are great) mean there’s less risk involved – but it simultaneously makes casual sex way less hot. It used to be “this feels so good I’m willing to risk X, Y, or  Z consequence”. Now it’s just a Tuesday night. 

Finally, the modern push for “everyone to have sex with everyone” is absolutely disgusting. 

1) Despite all our technological advancements frivolous sex is still dangerous – and I don’t just mean STD’s and teen pregnancies. Half the shit we quibble about in this country could be solved by kids growing up in 2 parent households.

2) If sex can be had with *anyone* it becomes meaningless and masturbatory – stripping us of one of the most euphoric moments the human experience has to offer. Bad vanilla sex with someone you intimately care about will almost always be better than even the hottest unceremonious hookup.

I want to talk about Batman, and why I find the character so interesting.

Batman isn’t about crime-fighting, or detectiving, or fancy-gadgeting, or anything łike that. All of these “super powers” actually stand as a foil to what I believe is a super weakness.

Batman is about loneliness.

He’s obviously physically lonely – an orphan from birth, no family, lives in a massive mansion and lurks around in a cave all night – but he’s also circumstantially and “relatably” lonely.

Bruce has a genius level IQ – essentially making him a prototypical polymath. He speaks 11 different languages and has achieved mastery in nearly every conceivable scientific enterprise: physics, biochemistry, engineering, history, comp-sci and linguistics just to name a few. He built *a teleportor*, a lazarus pit, and a universal translator. Sounds hyperbolic right? That’s the point.

If a room full of horny female comic book writers were charged with the task of coming up with the ideal male physique – it still probably wouldn’t hold a candle to Batman. He’s 6’2-210, and in a comic-book world where “sexy” is the default, somehow he still stands alone. He’s trained his body to physical perfection – mastering 127 different martial arts along the way.

Then, of course, there’s the money – of which he has a łot. Something to the tune of $80 billion.

Billionaire, 200+ level IQ, perfect body, can pull any girl he wants… Who can relate to that? All of these superficially nice characteristics only serve to further distinguish him from the common man. In a sense, he’s almost more alien than Superman.

Finally – and I think most importantly – Batman is *emotionally* lonely. He has no family, can’t tolerate a romantic relationship and his best friend is his Butler. He’s self-destructively isolating – keeping everybody at arms length and dealing with his feelings by beating the criminal underworld to a pulp with his bare hands.

Bruce Wayne isn’t supposed to be “flesh and blood”. The Batman archetype is the personification of loneliness – an embodied representation of isolation.

At the heart of the Batman mythos is a deeply broken, lonely individual who is trying to figure out how to navigate the world, and his relationships, while coping with loss. In a day and age where loneliness is running rampant, I think that’s why *this* specific character archetype has taken such a grip on our culture.
